911,"The Anarchists Cook Book – Chapter One: Drugs - Myles Reviews by Myles Power 1 year ago 13 minutes 270,147 views","When I was growing up, I remember hearing stories of a book that contained information so dangerous and controversial that to own a copy, even an electronic one, could get you in trouble with the authorities. This was because the book contained a set of instructions on how to, amongst other things, construct explosive devices and synthesise illegal narcotics. This infamous book, which has now sold more than 2 million copies, has been linked to countless acts of violence around the world including the Columbine massacre and the Oklahoma City bombing. I am, of course, talking about the #AnarchistsCookBook, which was written by 19-year-old #WilliamPowell in the early 1970s at the height of the Vietnam War Protests. I have recently got hold of a copy and, after reading it, my honest opinion is that I can’t see what all the fuss was about.

I got myself a copy of the book and once it arrived I began to read it and was almost immediately disappointed. Once I got past the rather obnoxious 16 pages on the the subject of “anarchism today”, followed by Powell’s introduction to the book, which reads very much like the angry ramblings of an angst-ridden teenage boy, I finally arrived at chapter one which is about the synthesis and purification of #Drugs.

Overall, this initial chapter is not dangerous because it tells people how to synthesise and purify illegal drugs, but because it contains instructions that could result in someone getting killed. It is clear that Powell simply read a handful of papers on the subject and thought you could easily substitute professional chemistry equipment with everyday household objects and achieve the same goal. Without a good understanding of chemistry, Powell ended up writing a chapter in which his choice of equipment, choice of solvents, and disregard for containment is a disaster waiting to happen. That is if you are able to get hold of the chemicals and the glassware required to attempt anything in this chapter in the first place.

It became apparent very early on, whilst attending these protests, that the majority of people in attendance were not there to protest against the agriculture company Monsanto, but instead to protest against #GeneticallyModifiedOrganisms (GMOs) in general. As someone who believes that GMOs have huge potential in helping to alleviate world hunger and improve standards of living on our planet, I was curious to hear what criticisms people had of this broad area of science. I was surprised to find that nearly all of the criticisms consisted of lies, half truths, misconceptions, and flat out ignorance. I decided to make a series of videos fact-checking some of the more convincing arguments made at these events in order to undo some of the damages I believe these people to be doing.

911,"Exposed: Fake Ugandan Red Cross Medical Trial That Fed People Bleach by Myles Power 1 year ago 46 minutes 111,704 views","Stitched together full documentary exposing the unethical “clinical trials” that took place in #Uganda back in 2012. In this video I show you how those involved designed an experiment to fool people into thinking you can cure malaria by drinking bleach.

What was once known as Miracle Mineral Supplement, but for legal reasons had to change its name to #MiracleMineralSolution (MMS), is a 28% sodium chlorite solution in distilled water currently being sold online as a cure-all tonic. Jim Humble, the man who coined the name and who is also the self-styled Archbishop of his own church (Genesis II), believes that once “activated” by an acidic solution, MMS can be used to cure people of our most feared illnesses including HIV, cancer, and malaria.

Chlorine dioxide or any other of the chemicals found or generated using MMS are not panaceas. There is no way of them to specifically target the source of any of the many things Jim is claiming they can. They will simply react with whatever they come into contact with, which can lead to some very unpleasant side effects. Even ingesting relatively small quantities of these toxic compounds can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.  However, Jim, and others who promote the use of MMS, does not necessarily believe this is a bad thing.

In higher doses, MMS can cause renal failure, hemolysis (a rupturing of the red blood cells), and even death. Yet, despite these well documented side effects, MMS is still being promoted online and, in recent years, has picked up steam by claiming to be a cure for autism in children. A “bishop” in Jim’s church named Kerri Rivera wrote a book called ‘Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism’ in which she recommends not only giving autistic children hourly doses of MMS, but also advocates the use of MMS enemas. It should come to no surprise that giving a child an enema of what is essentially bleach will damage the lining of their bowel.

Recently a video called “LEAKED: Proof the Red Cross Cured 154 Malaria Cases with MMS” that apparently shows a clinical trial organised in cooperation with the Ugandan Red Cross Society and the Water Reference Centre in Uganda back in 2012. It is alleged that the trial was designed to investigate MMS’ ability to cure those suffering from malaria. In the video, it is claimed that over 143 people tested positive for malaria and all were cured within 48 hours. 

Just as we know that every perpetual motion device is fake without looking into it, we know there is no possible way that MMS can cure malaria. Yes, we might come across incredible discoveries that change the way we look at the world, but we are not going to wake up one day and realise that the Earth is cube shaped. There is no possible way for MMS to cure malaria and, unlike most other snake oils out there, it poses a real threat because it’s an industrial bleach. With the people involved being reluctant to release any more information about the “trials”, we may well never know what really happened back then 100%, but I think I clearly shown in this video that their experiment was fundemently flawed that it shouldn’t be taken seriously.

The Olympic Switch Theory Debunked by Myles Power 1 year ago 22 minutes 687,285 views","In the early hours of April 15th, the British passenger liner RMS #Titanic, owned by the White Star Line, collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. At the time, some believed the ship to be “practically unsinkable” because of her system of watertight compartments, of which four could be flooded and the ship would still remain afloat. However, the iceberg tore a series of holes along the side of the hull, flooding six compartments, which sealed the ships fate. Less then three hours after the collision, Titanic would lay at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean…or did it? There is a rather fascinating and compelling #ConspiracyTheory that Titanic was switched with her sister ship, Olympic, and was purposefully sank as part of an insurance scam!

During his “turquoise period"", where he would often be seen wearing a turquoise shell suit because he believed the colour was a condiuoate for positive energy, he appeared on the Wogan show, where he talked about interpreting the will of “Godhead”, and how the world is about to end. Since then, he has become a professional #Conspiracy theorist and gives presentations to packed-out shows. I was able to get tickets for myself and my good friend Buck for his Middlesbrough showing, which lasted over 4 hours. In this video, we talk about our experiences that night.

It’s the story of how two con men with a history of selling bogus cure-alls to critically ill people patented a compound that is known to release hydrogen cyanide in the body so that they could make money off people dying from cancer!

I couldn't time the Stern segment prior to a commerical break so there's color bars until the video starts. If you wish to skip ahead, go to 1:07. It'll play what was on CBS affiliate WUSA 9 Washington, DC until Stern. 

One of many from a small project done on some slow days in Feb, 2016.

1:07 The Early Show was interviewing cast members of Everybody Loves Raymond with a short look into national and local DC forcasts, then after break aired a gormet food segment, and prior to the news interruption, was showing off updates of people who The Early Show helped made their wish come true earlier that year. Around this time, Howard was wrapping up an interview with a E! Network exec who announced a program dedicated to the deceased Henry ""Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf"" Nasiff, Jr, while taking a call from a girl mentioned in an article about how Howard Stern was ""undatable"" according to a matchmaking expert (a few women were mention as considerable candidates to Stern). Stern goes to break.
12:57 Stern returns from a commercial break. A (fake, recorded) interview with a Little League baseball player who lied about his age, and Kid Rock & Pamela Anderson were brought up due to an interview with Stern intern ""Stuttering"" John Melendez. The conversation went into how Howard would perform with Pamela intimately and sex stories.
15:46 First crash, North Tower, American Flight 11
20:12 WCBS-2 breaks in before the CBS network did 2 minutes later via The Early Show.
28:40 Stern interrupts the Pamela Anderson discussion to break the news of of the plane crash. Soon they return to Anderson.
33:00 Second Crash, South Tower, United Flight 175
33:52 K-ROCK general manager Tom Chiusano alerts Stern of the second crash. At first Stern and crew were uncertain.
35:27 Stern staff confirms via a call from a listener watching CNN.
38:07 Stern watches the replay of the second crash.
1:07:46 While Stern enters commercial, Third crash, Pentagon, American Flight 77
1:13:30 WCBS relays images of the Pentagon on fire from The Early Show.
1:15:07 Stern stops commercial early to break news of the Pentagon, and decided to avoid commercial breaks until he concluded the show. The additional audio is from the 9/11 retrospective presented by Howard TV.
1:28:48 Stern fan Zolar calls in just in time for the Stern crew and staff to see the South Tower collapse.
1:33:11 As Stern regular Lee ""Crazy Cabbie"" Siegfried laments on his view of the collapse, Fourth crash, Somerset County, PA, United Flight 93.
1:42:54 The rumor of the fourth crash being at the South Tower and making it collapse. It was proven false later. One of numerous rumors developing within the past 24 hours of the attacks, such as bombs within The DC National Mall and a hospital, that made citizens even more frightened.
1:58:06 The North Tower collapses.

Los atentados fueron cometidos por 19 miembros de Al Qaeda,​ divididos en cuatro grupos de secuestradores, cada uno de ellos con un terrorista piloto que se encargaría de pilotar el avión una vez ya reducida la tripulación de la cabina. El vuelo 11 de American Airlines y el vuelo 175 de United Airlines fueron los primeros en ser secuestrados, y ambos fueron estrellados contra las dos torres gemelas del World Trade Center, el primero contra la Torre Norte y el segundo poco después contra la Sur, provocando que ambos rascacielos se derrumbaran en las dos horas siguientes.​

El tercer avión secuestrado pertenecía al vuelo 77 de American Airlines y fue empleado para ser impactado contra una de las fachadas (concretamente la fachada oeste) del Pentágono, en Virginia. El cuarto avión, perteneciente al vuelo 93 de United Airlines, no alcanzó ningún objetivo al haberse estrellado en campo abierto, cerca de Shanksville, en Pensilvania, tras perder el control en cabina como consecuencia del enfrentamiento de los pasajeros y tripulantes contra el comando terrorista. Tenía como eventual objetivo el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos, ubicado en la ciudad de Washington.

Los atentados causaron más de 6000 heridos, la muerte de 2973 personas y la desaparición de otras 24,​ y resultaron muertos igualmente los 19 terroristas. Sumando también a los desaparecidos, murieron 3016 personas.

Los atentados, que fueron condenados inmediatamente como «horrendos ataques terroristas» por el Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, se caracterizaron por el empleo de aviones comerciales como armamento, provocando una reacción de temor generalizado en todo el mundo y particularmente en los países occidentales, que alteró desde entonces las políticas internacionales de seguridad aérea.","Las voces del 11S, documental en Español del Canal National Geographic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rMQu2B_3vU,-1,Spanish,0,2693,494014,3699,271,0,416,498400

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",History Buffs: Saving Private Ryan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1aGH6NbbyE,5,,0,1411,5382712,91119,3043,0,16624,5493498

The Saudis and Iranians have never actually declared war on each other. Instead, they fight indirectly by supporting opposing sides in other countries and inciting conflicts. This is known as proxy warfare. 

And it’s had a devastating effect on the region. Countries, especially poor ones, can’t function if there are larger countries pulling strings within their borders. 

And that’s exactly what's happening in the Middle East. The Saudi-Iranian rivalry has become a fight over influence, and the whole region is a battlefield.

911,"This Is What a Nuclear War Would Actually Look Like (HBO) by VICE News 2 years ago 5 minutes, 19 seconds 2,439,578 views","As Secretary of Defense under President Clinton, Bill Perry has spent most of his life watching the world prepare for nuclear war. And given the current political climate, he thinks the world isn’t nearly as scared as it should be.

Since the dawn of the nuclear age in the 1940s, most of the worlds nuclear capability was split between the U.S. and Russia. The umbrella of American protection meant that its allies didn’t have to develop nukes of their own.

But that appears to be changing.

President Donald Trump has been less hawkish about standing up to Russia. Now, European Union is reportedly considering a nuclear deterrent of its own. During the first week of March — after reports came out that as he left office, President Barack Obama warned Trump that North Korea would be “the most urgent” problem — North Korea fired four missiles that landed just 200 miles from Japan.

All of this has experts, including Perry, worried about an era of renewed nuclear threat from jittery states and rogue actors. Perry often talks about his nightmare scenario: a small amount of enriched uranium falling into the hands of a terrorist group.

“I think of all of the nuclear catastrophes that could happen, this is the most probable,” the 89-year-old said. “I think, I would say, there’s probably an even chance, this would happen sometime in the next 10 years.”

911,"Why The US Has No High-Speed Rail by CNBC 1 month ago 16 minutes 4,938,452 views","China has the world’s fastest and largest high-speed rail network — more than 19,000 miles, the vast majority of which was built in the past decade.

Japan’s bullet trains can reach nearly 200 miles per hour and date to the 1960s. They have moved more than 9 billion people without a single passenger causality. casualty 

France began service of the high-speed TGV train in 1981 and the rest of Europe quickly followed.

But the U.S. has no true high-speed trains, aside from sections of Amtrak’s Acela line in the Northeast Corridor. The Acela can reach 150 mph for only 34 miles of its 457-mile span. Its average speed between New York and Boston is about 65 mph.

California’s high-speed rail system is under construction, but whether it will ever get completed as intended is uncertain.

Watch the video to see why the U.S. continues to fail with high-speed trains, and some companies that are trying to fix that.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",Paul McCartney Carpool Karaoke,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjvzCTqkBDQ,5,,0,1423,43228557,739892,13102,0,62243,44043794

In fact, it's so weird, if it wasn't for the cameras, you'd be hard pressed to believe any of it even happened. But, tragically, this is a real story. It began when forty-year-old identical twins from Sweden wandered out onto one of Britain's busiest motorways. That single moment of madness triggered a sequence of events that ended in murder.

Finally at 1:06:43, the news anchor makes the sad official confirmation that Kennedy died 38 minutes earlier.

911,"The Unspoken Reality Behind the Harvard Gates | Alex Chang | TEDxSHSID by Ivy-Way Academy 5 months ago 13 minutes 3,240,212 views","Back in high school, Alex was not exactly ""Ivy League material."" He did not even finish top 5 in his public high school in New York, did not get a near-perfect SAT score, did not win national honors in math, was not a starter on his lacrosse team, and did not have rich and famous parents to get him into places. Therefore, his story of being accepted and completing his education at Harvard College and Harvard Graduate School of Education as an ""ordinary student"" served as the prime model for high school students who want to reach their dream schools. However, in addition to sharing his secrets to Ivy League admission, Alex feels the social responsibility to inform—and warn—students about the life behind those Ivy League gates. Things may not always be as pretty as they seem.

911,"How the rich get richer – money in the world economy | DW Documentary by DW Documentary 1 year ago 42 minutes 2,299,834 views","Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? 

For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.

The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.

During the Second World War SS Intelligence developed a secret weapon to undermine and ruin the British war effort – it was a weapon made of paper. Operation Bernhard – the Nazi codename for this covert project – became the biggest currency forgery in history, counterfeiting, at today’s value, over three billion pounds. The 104-strong workforce who produced the money were all Jewish prisoners isolated in a special workshop at Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. With the threat of death hanging over them they skilfully printed banknotes, which the Bank of England described as: “the most dangerous forgeries ever seen”. For the first time four of these Jewish prisoners speak out about their enforced collaboration with the Nazis, what happened to the fake millions they produced, and how they themselves survived, by a miracle, to tell the story.

Here’s a look at daredevils who tragically lost their lives doing insane stunts.

The human capacity for dreaming up bizarre stunts is perhaps only surpassed by the public's desire to watch people do bizarre stunts, which has proven to be a pretty lethal combo. In October 2017, Malaysian magician Lim Ba attempted a stunt which involved him sitting inside a giant wok with some rice and sweet corn. 

Lim had been performing this particular stunt for more than a decade, and held a record of 75 minutes within the larger-than-life wok. However, the magician was also approaching 70, receiving treatment for high blood pressure, and had recently undergone a heart bypass. Needless to say, he wasn't in peak physical condition at the time of his death.

About 30 minutes into the performance, Lim started knocking on the inside of the wok. Upon removing the cover, onlookers found him unconscious - and by the time medical personnel arrived to the scene, Lim had passed away. The official cause of death was a heart attack, though police noted that the performer also suffered second-degree burns.

Deep in Siberia's Taiga forest is Vissarion, a cult leader who looks like Jesus and claims to be the voice of God. He's known as ""the Teacher"" to his 4,000 followers, who initially seem surprisingly normal. Over time, however, their unflinching belief in UFOs and the Earth's imminent demise made this group start to look more and more like some sort of strange cult.

Invading Iraq is a special two-hour documentary investigation recounting the key strategies, battles and turning points of the war from both sides of the battlefield - ending with the story of Saddam's capture. The documentary takes viewers behind the scenes of the allied invasion and advance on Baghdad. Through first-hand accounts from key commanders, frontline soldiers and civilians on both sides of the conflict, the film offers a rare battlefield perspective of the war as seen through the eyes of those who lived it. It also shows how the false assessment of Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction was just the first in a series of major intelligence failures that shaped the course of the war and led to the unstable occupation America and Britain are now mired in.

Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases. The speed of tsunami waves depends on ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. Tsunami waves may travel as fast as jet planes over deep waters, only slowing down when reaching shallow waters. While tsunamis are often referred to as tidal waves, this name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little to do with these giant waves. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was triggered by a 9.3 magnitude earthquake with the initial surge wave of the tsunami measuring 33 metres. It was the largest earthquake-generated tsunami in history. Certain places in the world are subject to earthquakes and tsunamis more than others as there are only seven tectonic plates covering the earth and the borders of these plates lie in certain areas.

911,"Before the Big Bang 1 - Loop Quantum Cosmology Explained by skydivephil 5 years ago 43 minutes 345,295 views","What happened before the big bang? It's one of the most popular questions in astronomy.  When the observable universe is smaller than an atom our classical theory of gravity, Einstein's theory of General Relativity, breaks down and needs to be modified with a theory that can also accommodate the physics of the sub atomic world, quantum mechanics. Armed with a quantum theory of gravity cosmologists may be able to tackle the question of what happened before the big bang. Loop quantum cosmology is considered one of the most promising candidates for such a theory. In this film we interview some of the leading scientists in the field to explain this exciting theoretical development. We ask what happened before the big bang? Is there a multiverse? Why was the entropy of the universe so low in the past? Could the Planck spacecraft anomalies be signs of the pre big bang universe? How do we test these ideas? Should we accept the claims that the universe really has a beginning?
In some sections of the film there is CGI animation to help visualise the evolution of the universe. These are for illustrative purposes only and should not be taken too literally. For example, the big bang is not an explosion from a single point and a quantum bridge would not really look like a tunnel; the universe is 4-dimensional, not 2- or even 3-dimensional, so these images are simply to assist the explanation.
 
All of the video was shot by us on a Sony VG900 full frame video camera. Other images were provided by:

911,"7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After) by Wild We Roam 2 months ago 14 minutes 6,409,203 views","DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center (https://www.healthpromoting.com/) in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. 

It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. 

You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! 

Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. 

Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.

911,"The Great Non-GMO Project Verification Swindle by Myles Power 3 months ago 19 minutes 62,074 views","Did you ever wonder why products with the Non-GMO Project label don’t say “contains zero GMOs” or “GMO-free”? It’s because the company doesn’t want to mislead the consumer!!!
According to the Non-GMO Project’s own project standards, a product can be contaminated with up to 5% and still have a Non-GMO Project Verified label slapped on the side of it. Call me crazy, but surely the amount of GMOs allowed in a product with a label that says “Non-GMO Project Verified” should be zero! The fact that there is an allowance means that Non-GMO Verified doesn’t mean non-GMO! 
The Non-GMO Project Verification is a scam, in my opinion. It’s predatory marketing disguised as a grassroots movement relying on, and amplifying, the ignorance of its own consumers. It survives by distorting science and promoting a false narrative that GMOs pose a real health risk. The company ignores the scientific consensus on GMOs, opting instead to promote fantasies from people who, if they had their own way, a large chunk of the world’s population would be wiped off the face of the planet and autistic children would be getting bleach enemas from cultists. The fact that the label doesn’t necessarily mean that the product is GMO-free is as deceptive as putting a “does not contain human” label on soylent green. The label is meaningless, and is just a way to scare consumers into paying a premium!

The position of the aircraft disappeared from air traffic control, indicating the aircraft’s transponder was no longer functioning. Malaysian military radar continued to trace the aircraft, which almost immediately began to change direction. Several hours later, an hour after the aircraft’s scheduled arrival time at Beijing, Malaysia Airlines issued a press statement announcing that Flight 370 was missing. At this time, unbeknownst to members of the press and family members of those onboard #MH370, the aircraft was still in the air, and would be for at least another 50 minutes before disappearing completely. 

Over the next four years, an extensive search for the remains of the aircraft and its passengers was carried out, but yielded no results. The search, which covered over 46,332 sq miles and cost a reported 160 million USD finally ended in May of 2018, when the Malaysian government stated that it had no plans to extend the search any further. The disappearance of Flight 370, with its 239 crew and passengers, still remains one of the most enduring mysteries in aviation history. 

In the absence of a definitive explanation for MH370’s disappearance, many #ConspiracyTheories have flourished. Some are rather reasonable and not far outside the realm of possibility, whereas others are completely bonkers. So, without further adieu, here is my countdown for the top 5 most bonkers MH370 conspiracies debunked.

Check out more episodes from The VICE Guide to Travel here: http://bit.ly/1id8igT

VICE travels to West Africa to rummage through the messy remains of a country ravaged by 14 years of civil war. Despite the United Nation's eventual intervention, most of Liberia's young people continue to live in abject poverty, surrounded by filth, drug addiction, and teenage prostitution. The former child soldiers who were forced into war have been left to fend for themselves, the murderous warlords who once led them in cannibalistic rampages have taken up as so-called community leaders, and new militias are lying in wait for the opportunity to reclaim their country from a government they rightly mistrust.

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa began in Guinea in December 2013. From there, it quickly spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Cases also appeared in Senegal and Nigeria, and there was another outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Today, Liberia is at the center of the epidemic, with more than 3,000 cases of infection. About half of them have been fatal. 

As President Barack Obama announced that he would be sending American military personnel to West Africa to help combat the epidemic, VICE News traveled to Monrovia to spend time with those on the front lines of the outbreak.

There’s no doubt that the government will always find ways to control us and in many cases manipulate or brainwash us, too. There have also been enough recorded cases where conspiracy theories turned out to be more than theories.

Nowadays, however, the term “conspiracy theory” has come almost exclusively to refer to any crazy theory that attempts to explain a historical or current event as the result of a secret plot by conspirators of almost superhuman power and cunning. Examining and analyzing the facts is always good but in these 25 cases we feel like some dudes have literally overdone it. What do you think?

The former governor also weighed in on President Barack Obama’s newly announced strategy for dealing with the radical Islamic State, saying that if Saddam Hussein were still in power, we would not be facing this new terrorist threat.

The most exciting underwater story of the modern age

On June 19th 2011 the Swedish-based diving company Ocean Explorer discovered something extraordinary. They were exploring in the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Finland, looking for sunken treasures when a very unusual image suddenly appeared on the sonar. A 197ft diameter cylindrical object was discovered at the depth of approximately 275 feet, something they had never seen before.

In this documentary special, we follow the treasure hunters and their crew on their expedition to reveal what could be the most extraordinary discovery in deep sea ever. We share the tension, the excitement and the nervousness that threats – both known and unknown – may be enforced. There is reason to believe that their ship is under surveillance.

Using advanced equipment - ROW cameras, sonar pictures and human divers, we discover that the findings really are something very strange and incredibly unique.

Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? By Karen Dawisha

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

The 10 Questions:
1. How reliable is the source of the claim?
2.Does the source make similar claims?
3. Have the claims been verified by somebody else?
4. Does this fit with the way the world works?
5. Has anyone tried to disprove the claim?
6. Where does the preponderance of evidence point?
7. Is the claimant playing by the rules of science?
8. Is the claimant providing positive evidence?
9. Does the new theory account for as many phenomena as the old theory?
10. Are personal beliefs driving the claim?

The documentary consists of interviews with scientists and AIDS denialists discussing the link between HIV and AIDS, the severity of AIDS in South Africa and, unbelievably, whether or not HIV exists at all. Brent claims that the documentary gives an “objective examination of the idea the HIV causes AIDS” but nothing could be further from the truth in this sneakily edited piece of propaganda. After viewing it myself, and realising how the movie tried to mislead viewers, I made a series of videos debunking several of the claims it made.

911,"The 9/11 Decade | The Intelligence War | Al Jazeera World by Al Jazeera English 7 years ago 47 minutes 1,499,209 views","Immediately after 9/11, the US announced that 'the gloves were coming off' in the fight against al-Qaeda. A unique Presidential Finding gave the CIA greater powers than it had enjoyed at any point in its history. 

Electronic eavesdropping, kidnap, rendition and water-boarding were the results. 

The film explores how the CIA fought al-Qaeda in the shadows, focusing on the monitoring of its communications, the group's escape from Tora Bora and the problems this raised. 

We examine the highs and lows of the intelligence war, revealing how the US nearly lost outright in 2003 and how al-Qaeda negated its own advances through a bloody campaign to eliminate Iraq's Shias. 

This is the story of the secret war behind the 'war on terror'.

But as long as you're far from the blast, you're safe, right? Wrong. In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.’s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

911,"Why Are 96,000,000 Black Balls on This Reservoir? by Veritasium 1 month ago 12 minutes 34,043,935 views","I took a boat through 96 million black plastic balls on the Los Angeles reservoir to find out why they're there. The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.

Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!

The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.

Special thanks to Patreon supporters:
Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.

Thanks to:
Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dump
Euro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footage

Four Corners exclusively brings you the story of the Sharrouf children and their grandmother's epic fight to find them and bring them home to Australia.

The children of the notorious jihadist Khaled Sharrouf were taken to the self-declared caliphate in 2014. 

The world learned of them after their father published pictures of his eldest son holding the severed head of an IS prisoner, sending shockwaves around the world.

For five years their grandmother, Karen Nettleton, has been trying to reach the children and bring them home.

She has mounted several rescue missions, with each one ending in failure. Now, in Syria, she's making a last-ditch effort to save them from the squalid al-Hawl refugee camp.

A gunman killed himself after opening fire on a Florida school board meeting. He was confronted by two school officials, one who attacked him with her purse, and another, the security chief, who fired his gun at the shooter.

Police said a 56-year-old man disrupted the the Bay District School Board meeting in Panama City, Fla., walked up to the podium, pulled out a can of red spray paint and painted a large letter ""V"" with a circle around it.

""The shooter approached the front of the board members, spray painted a symbol on the wall and fired an unknown amount of rounds,"" said Panama City Police Department spokesman Sgt. Jeff Becker.

911,"Watch How Police Caught Chris Watts, Family Murderer, With Body Language - Police Body Cameras by Derek Van Schaik 6 months ago 37 minutes 23,936,983 views","Witness the exact moments when police knew Chris Watts was guilty in his family’s disappearance and the eventual found murder of his pregnant wife (Shanann) and two young daughters (Bella and Celeste). We’re going to analyze Chris’s body language from police body cameras to show you when police knew he did it.

Chris Watts is the Frederick (northern Colorado) man who eventually admitted to murdering his pregnant wife (Shanann Watts, pregnant with Nico Lee Watts) and two young daughters (Bella Watts and Celeste Watts) on the morning of August 13, 2018.  Early that morning, Chris Watts covered up the scene of his crime by loading his deceased pregnant wife and two young daughters into the back seat of his work truck, which took him about 50 minutes.

His pregnant wife, Shanann, was found buried in a shallow grave in an eastern Colorado oil field (CERVI 319) where Chris worked and the bodies of his two little girls were found dumped in oil tanks.  I live just 40 minutes south of where all this happened, so this case literally hits close to home.

At first Chris Watts claimed his family was just missing and that’s where we’re going to start in this video. We’re going to watch through police body cameras how this first day unfolded and I’ll point out Chris’s body language which caused police to really suspect he was guilty.  Since cameras are now everywhere with doorbell cameras, police body cameras, and cell phone cameras, it’s shocking to witness first-hand how everything unfolded and then unraveled quickly for Chris that first day.

In the comments: What do you think Chris Watts was thinking about when he was watching his neighbor's security camera footage?

Give this video a thumbs up so I know you liked it and I’ll do a follow up video on the FBI’s interrogation tactics used on Chris Watts, which got him to finally confess.

Also, filming and photographing is allowed throughout the camp except for the ""room of hair"" which I did not film out of respect for the people who suffered a great deal at this place. There are multiple signs showing ""no flash photography"" because this is not only disruptive and rude towards the people paying their respect but it also alters the items coloring over time. You can go to the website below and see it says on their website what is and isn't allowed to be filmed:

http://auschwitz.org/en/press/filming-and-photographing 

-

My regular vlogs are very happy and positive but this one is very different... I've always wanted to go visit auschwitz to see it for myself. I brought my camera with me so I could share this experience with people who wish to go see this place one day as well. Its a difficult thing to do but I believe it is necessary.

The Islamic State now governs its caliphate from the north central Syrian city of Raqqa, which was once a relatively westernized agricultural hub. As the State's power base, Raqqa is where it imposes its version of Sharia law throughout large swaths of Iraq and Syria.
 
The “Hisbah” are the new Sharia police. In the latest episode of The Islamic State, VICE News joins them on their daily patrols during Ramadan, and witnesses how they check on shops and scrutinize produce, while at the same time ensuring their strict rules on women’s appearances are adhered to.
 
We are also taken to an Islamic State prison and speak with inmates accused of abusing drugs and selling alcohol. There we learn firsthand of the prisoners’ punishments, and how they have since “rediscovered” their devotion to the Islamic faith since their incarceration — but are yet to be granted permission to declare their allegiance to the caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

911,"1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression - (Documentary) by TradingCoachUK 11 months ago 58 minutes 347,618 views","Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929
BBC documentary

On October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.

1929 Stock Market Crash

During the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.

Stock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.


1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression

After October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America’s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.

The personalities and spectres of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin loom large in the events of the twentieth Century. They were similar in some respects and yet very different in others.

The first in a series that examines the interaction of the leading protagonists of WW2, this program looks in some depth at the nature of the relationship and interaction of these two ‘warlords’. The use of primary materials and memoirs as sources gives the psycho-historical analysis some substance.

He and several female followers were convicted of at least seven murders, including actress Sharon Tate - then eight months pregnant. The world was shocked not just by the cruelty of the crimes but the robot-like behaviour of Manson's 'family' during their trial. For many, the only comfort was the thought that Manson would be put away for life. That's why this 1981 interview caused such a stir. Not only do we see Manson, cold and unrepentant - but we hear his thoughts on gaining parole and getting out of prison 'to play like a human'.

Kennedy in November, 1963, for many people there remain troubling questions about the official story: Was Lee Harvey Oswald the killer? Did he act alone or was it a conspiracy?

Now, thousands of once-secret classified documents about the Kennedy assassination have finally been made public. Can those recently-released records explain the inexplicable -- and what’s in the thousands of assassination records they still refuse to release? When The Fifth Estate first broadcast its investigation into the JFK assassination back in 1983, it was the most watched show in the program’s history. Now Bob McKeown updates that story, with new interviews with some of the leading investigators of the JFK mystery: what did they find in those files, and what questions do they still have?

James ""The Amazing"" Randi is the perfect mix of Science and Magic, a true conjurer of visual machinations that can fool our senses while, at the same time, explaining to us how our senses are fooled.

In my opinion this is the best example of a ""human mind debugger"", he gets right into the machinations of analog tricks and sees how our brains mistakenly manifests them as a possible reality. Randi also teaches us that illusion and trickery may be comforting to the human mind, but truth is far much more wonderful as it shows us the machinations from the chaos, the sense as well as the awe in both the tricks and the real world.

For several decades, Randi has gone on to expose hundreds of psychics and teach millions across the globe about how they could be fooled into believing in a system which could potentially make them vulnerable to trickery and perhaps psychical harm. 

Randi is not afraid to go against popular opinion, as shown in his battle against so-called psychic Uri Geller in the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
Randi has also gone against the bizarre practice of faith ""healing"" and contacting the deceased, and has exposed the cruel, callous and cynical nature of the people who claim to be performing ""God's will"", such as Peter Popoff.
Randi has also warned us time and time again about the fraudulent practice that is homeopathic medicine and how it is essentially water solution, dished out as hocus-pocus medicine. 

James Randi is the founder of The James Randi Educational Foundation, an organisation that attempts to bring reason to world by luring potential psychics into a trap, baited by a million dollar prize to prove their psychic ""powers"". ""powers"" here is a kind of vague term,as Randi knows, so the tests are usually on the so-called psychic's terms. No self-acclaimed psychic has ever won the prize.

Whether or not some form of psychic power exists is still an open question, however many psychics often do not properly gauge their so-called skills and instead brag about them, hence scepticism about such claims should not be so strange to their ears. 

Unfortunately the vast amount of psychic powers they have seem to remove all self-esteem as many psychics are often uneasy about Randi's reasonable request and attractive million dollar reward.",James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics Documentary (Full),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI,5,,0,3258,2605923,24589,1220,0,6225,2637957

911,"Nazi medical crimes | DW Documentary by DW Documentary 6 months ago 42 minutes 1,095,199 views","The Allied occupation of Strasbourg on November 23, 1944, spelled the end of the Reich University. Most professors had fled, but Johannes Stein, Dean of the Medical Faculty, stayed on. What did he know about the crimes of the National Socialists?

Most professors had already fled, only a few had stayed on. One of them was Johannes Stein, Dean of the Medical Faculty and grandfather of Kirsten Esch, the author of this film. This documentary is her coming to terms with her own family history. During the Third Reich, this university was seen as a prestige project of National Socialism. Intended as a spiritual bulwark of German culture in occupied Alsace, it was meant to spread Nazi ideology westwards and even eclipse the Sorbonne in Paris. The faculties were staffed with what were purportedly the best minds in Germany, including the Third Reich’s leading lawyer Ernst Rudolf Huber, and the physicist and later peace researcher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. In her film, the author looks at her grandfather’s role as Dean of the Medical Faculty. What did he know about the crimes committed there? Did he ever visit the nearby Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp, where August Hirt conducted unspeakable ""experiments"" on human beings? But Kirsten Esch also looks at the Reich University as a place of resistance, and talks about the local students who, led by Alphonse Adam, opposed the compulsory conscription of Alsatian men to the German Wehrmacht. For their resistance, many were sentenced to death.

Correction at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would “indefinitely suspend” the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam’s resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong’s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China’s favor.

Watch this video to understand the news coming out of Hong Kong and the history that led up to this moment.

When Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, Chinese leaders agreed that Hong Kong would be able to keep its economic and political systems, including some of the civil freedoms denied to China’s citizens on the mainland, for the next 50 years.

Although Hong Kong still has nearly 30 years of semi-autonomy left, China has started tightening its grip, and many believe it is chipping away at Hong Kong’s freedoms. In this episode, I explore how Hong Kong is dealing with the looming deadline and China’s premature moves.

Since Buckingham Palace doesn’t shy away from procedure, it's no surprise there’s already a comprehensive plan in place for what happens after she passes, known as Operation London Bridge. On the day Queen Elizabeth II dies, her death will elicit a comprehensive plan that has been in place since the 1960s. What will happen when Her Majesty's reign comes to an end and how will Britain mourn the loss? Here is what we know so far.

A tense standoff between the U.S. and Iran, following the downing of an American surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz. 
Iranian state television has been showing what it says is drone wreckage retrieved at sea.
American media say President Donald Trump ordered air strikes against military targets in Iran - but then later changed his mind.
Congressional leaders were briefed on the incident and called for a robust response, but they also told the president to act with caution.
So what does this mean for an already tense region?

The Conspiracy On The Death Of The Princess of Wales by Best of British Documentaries 4 years ago 50 minutes 937,754 views","The Diana movie, starring Naomi Watts, is set to be released in September 2013 and said to be first and foremost a love story. With all eyes and thoughts returning to the tragic story, we are able to deliver on this heartfelt documentrary examining the conspiracy theories and revealing the truths behind the mystery of her untimely death in 1997.

Following Diana's sudden death in Paris, August 31 1997, many doubts have surrounded the official story that she was killed in a tragic accident. No event since the assassination of President Kennedy has attracted more conspiracy theories than the death of Princess Diana. This film tries to get behind the theories and uncover the mystery of Diana's untimely death.
At the last count, there were 36,000 websites devoted to conspiracy theories about her death and according to one poll, 78% of the British public believes her death was no accident. This view is apparently common throughout the Islamic world too.

In this one-hour film, we examine the main conspiracy theories and look at the evidence. Did she fake her own death to escape the paparazzi? Did the British Secret Service kill her to stop a Muslim connection to the Royal Family?

We tell the story of what actually did happen on that August weekend and ask if the facts do or do not support the idea that the death of Diana was no accident.",Who Really Killed Diana?

I am currently in the middle of re-making my #9/11 debunking videos. In the meantime, here is all my previous videos stitched together. 

A sceptical look at claims made by 'truther' protestors at ground zero in September 2012 from the viewpoint of a chemist. For those of you who don’t know, a ‘truther’ is a person affiliated with the 9/11 Truth movement, who rejects the official explanation provided for the 9/11 attacks and instead claims that a US government conspiracy was to blame. The videos in this series cover everything from the alleged thermite found in the dust to the collapse of #WorldTradeCentre 7. The videos debunk every claim made by the truthers by looking at the scientific literature and studying real video evidence of the attacks.

911,"9/11 conspiracies debunked by explosives expert by Rebel Media 3 years ago 10 minutes 70,518 views","David Menzies talks with explosives expert Ron Craig, who debunks many of the conspiracy theories surrounding the September 11, 2001 Muslim terrorist attacks.

He says theories that the WTC buildings were brought down by controlled explosions are based on faulty photo interpretation and personal testimonials of survivors.

Was thermite used to cut the buildings' steel columns? Do the huge clouds of dust prove explosives were used? What really happened to Building #7? Is it true that no steel frame building has ever collapsed from fire?

Not only are they at the heart of recent far-right terrorist attacks, they spread like wildfire on social media, and they are gaining ground among the young and educated. What is their appeal? And what can we do to stop them?
 Elise Wang has been teaching at Duke since January 2018, after receiving her PhD at Princeton and master's degree at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. She believes that teaching is a transformative act. In settings from prisons to university lecture halls to ESL classrooms, Dr. Wang strives to bring all students - but especially those who feel themselves at the margins of the classroom - to the center of scholarly debate. She feels strongly that such attention helps students connect deeply to their education, because it allows them to see it not as a measure of their value, but as a supporting character in the story of their lives. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

911,"Richard Gage: 9/11 Truth and Justice by KenFM 2 months ago 1 hour 40,588 views","Most of us know by now that there were three towers that collapsed on September 11th 2001. Three towers, two planes. What sounds strange to any primary pupil, is still referred to as ""the official version"" which equals ""the truth"", at least in the eyes of our governments and their mouthpiece - the mass media. Anyone questioning this kind of truth, sees himself bombarded with accusations of being a conspiracy theorist, who has watched too many dubious YouTube videos from crazy people that have lost their mind.

Well, one thing is for sure: The guy you will see in this video clearly hasn’t lost his mind, although he would have had every reason for it. His name is Richard Gage and he is an architect from San Francisco, California. With all the experience that he has gathered along his career path, he came to the conclusion that the official story, which we are being told, simply must be wrong. Soon after realizing this, he saw that he wasn’t the only one in his field thinking this way and founded the organization ""Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth"". Over the years, more than 3.000 professionals joined the organization, which is calling for new investigations in the case of 9/11.

In November 2018, 17 years after the attacks, Gage gave a speech in Basel, Switzerland. In it, he tackled the question whether the collapses of the three World Trade Center towers show any features of a controlled demolition. KenFM has filmed the presentation and with it not only Gage’s answer to this question, but also those of thousands of trained experts from all around the globe.

Viele Menschen wissen inzwischen, dass am 11. September 2001 drei Türme eingestürzt sind. Drei Türme – Zwei Flugzeuge! Was sich schon für jeden Grundschüler ziemlich rätselhaft anhört, wird uns heute noch immer als „die offizielle Version“ und damit auch als „die Wahrheit“ verkauft, zumindest seitens unserer Regierungen und ihrer Sprachrohre – den Massenmedien. Jeder der es wagt, derartige Wahrheiten auch nur in Frage zu stellen, muss sich im Gegenzug auf massive Diffamierungskampagnen einstellen. Man sei ein Verschwörungstheoretiker, ein Realitätsverweigerer, der schlicht zu viele skurrile Videos von durchgedrehten YouTubern konsumiert habe.

Nun, eines ist sicher: Das Attribut „durchgedrehter YouTuber“ trifft auf Richard Gage sicherlich nicht zu. Richard Gage ist ein Architekt aus San Francisco in Kalifornien. Auf Basis seiner jahrelangen Berufserfahrung kam er zu dem Fazit, dass die Geschichte, die uns allen von Regierungsseite eingetrichtert wurde, von vorne bis hinten lückenhaft ist.

Schnell realisierte er, dass er nicht der einzige Zweifler in seinem Berufsstand ist und gründete daraufhin die Organisation „Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth“, der sich über die Jahre mehr als 3.000 einschlägige Fachleute angeschlossen haben. Zusammen fordern sie, dass der Fall 11. September endlich neu untersucht wird.

Im November 2018, über 17 Jahre nach den Anschlägen, hielt Gage einen Vortrag im schweizerischen Basel. Er widmet sich der Frage, ob die Einstürze der drei Türme des World Trade Centers Merkmale einer kontrollierten Sprengung aufweisen. Gage liefert in seinem Vortrag beeindruckende Indizien dafür.

One of the core pieces of evidence for this belief is the presence of millions of microscopic iron spheres in the WTC dust. It is falsely claimed these microspheres could only have come from the use of explosives, and so their presence proves controlled demolition. Why does this false belief persist after being debunked over a decade ago?I explain the misconceptions about iron microspheres that keep the belief alive, and how to discuss these misconceptions with 9/11 conspiracy theorists. I’ll show where the WTC microspheres probably came from. There will be a live demonstration of one method of making iron microspheres using materials from the hotel gift shop, along with quick descriptions of ten other methods the fire marshal won’t let me show.

STORYLINE:_x000D_
The US Defence Department on Tuesday released the first video images of American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon on 11 September 2001. _x000D_
The images, recorded by Pentagon security cameras outside the building, were made public in response to a December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch, a public interest group. _x000D_
Some still images from the video had previously been leaked and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release._x000D_
The aeroplane is a thin white blur on the video as it hits the Pentagon at ground level. _x000D_
Almost instantly, a white flash and a huge orange fireball appear on the video, followed by a tower of grey-black smoke. _x000D_
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch, says the organisation fought for the video to be released because they thought it was important to complete the public record of the attacks._x000D_
""Also, it's a reminder about the terrible nature of the terrorist threat we face as a country,"" he added. _x000D_
He also said he hoped the video would put an end to conspiracy theories that the US government was somehow involved in the attacks. _x000D_
Travelling at an estimated 350 miles per hour (560 kilometres per hour), the hijacked American Airlines plane ploughed into the southwest side of the Pentagon at mid-morning, shortly after two other hijacked airlines were flown into the Twin Towers at the World Trade Centre in New York. _x000D_
The attack set off fires in part of the Pentagon and killed 125 people inside, in addition to the 59 passengers and crew and the five men who hijacked the plane at Dulles International Airport._x000D_
According to a Pentagon spokeswoman, families of the victims of the Pentagon attack were not consulted before the videos were released on the Pentagon's web site._x000D_

Matthew Dentith is the world's foremost conspiracy theory theorist. In this funny yet thought-provoking talk, he explores our instinctive aversion to conspiracy theories and suggests that, sometimes, they may hold the truth.

Author of ‘The Philosophy of Conspiracy Theories’, Dr Matthew Dentith specialises in the analysis of conspiracy theories whilst also being a keen teacher of critical thinking skills. He also co-hosts ‘The Podcaster’s Guide to the Conspiracy’ and can be heard every Thursday morning at 8.15am for 10 minutes discussing conspiracy theories with Zac on 95bFM’s Breakfast Show.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Just because it's a conspiracy doesn't mean it isn't true | Matthew Dentith | TEDxChristchurch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlvS-GrA00I,1,,1,783,208461,2135,355,0,575,211526

Why can we find geometric shapes in the night sky? How can we know that at least two people in London have exactly the same number of hairs on their head? And why can patterns be found in just about any text — even Vanilla Ice lyrics? PatrickJMT describes the Ramsey theory, which states that given enough elements in a set or structure, some interesting pattern among them is guaranteed to emerge.

It's been a heroic undertaking to rebuild downtown New York City after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Within days of this national tragedy, I personally installed a camera to webcast the rescue and recovery for the families, and the world, to see the brave determination of first responders. As the recovery effort continued, we installed more cameras to document the rebuilding and construction of the site. This commemorative time-lapse honors the victims of 9/11 and is dedicated to their families and friends, with special gratitude to the first responders and the steadfast construction teams. 

A super hardworking team at EarthCam, who I am so proud to work with, spent countless hours keeping the many webcams at the World Trade Center active for 4,617 days (and counting). This unprecedented effort provided our in-house editors with over 1 million images to choose from when creating this two-and-a-half minute video, as well as our other commemorative World Trade Center movies.

We at EarthCam are committed to continuing this photographic documentation to educate future generations and have donated all the images as well as the original camera to the 9/11 Memorial Museum.

I hope this time-lapse serves as a way to recognize that for the 10 years of construction, there was constant progress made to rebuild these important 16 acres of America.

Dear friends and followers. In today´s video, I´ll be showing you some key facts what you have to know about cockpit windows. What they are made of (Herculite II glass), how thick they are, how the electrical heating system works and we´ll take a closer look at the Airbus Sliding window operation. I´ll mention all the little clips and pockets around the sliding window and what they are good for: 
-Headset cable retainer 
-Dimmable light above the airport charts 
-Paper clip 
-Pen Pocket 
-EFB(Electronic Flight Bag) pocket 
-Cup Holder 
-Sun Visor 
-Two control handles
Did you know that pilots have a fridge in the cockpit?  
Or that the cockpit sliding window is the secondary escape route for the pilots in case of an emergency situation after an unfortunate landing? 
Can you imagine how much six Airbus Cockpit windows cost? 
I´ll shortly mention the Airbus SMOKE REMOVAL CHECKLIST, but can´t go into further detail, that´s a whole other video. 

All these topics will be covered in today´s video. So sit back and enjoy the video tutorial! 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

Looks its this simple, you breathe in oxygen, and breathe out carbon dioxide.  Thats because your body is using the oxygen to burn sugar in your body, then using that energy to live.

If your really nourished from prana... or chi.... why would you be breathing out carbon dioxide?

I had some inquiries about the data logger I used here.  Im not paid by these folks in any way.

Quick summary is pricey, but gets the job done!

The device is called a 'labquest2'
https://www.vernier.com/products/interfaces/labq2/
its kinda a stand alone version of the pi but but is a lot more user friendly.  It will datalog up to 4 detectors at the time.

it can also be used with a good range of detectors (which was the main selling point for me)
https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/

They are all pricey, but the functionality is pretty good.  I looked at a whole range of gas detectors before settling on this one.  Most were related to flue gas or exhaust testing.  Most dont 'measure' everything, they will detect oxygen, and calculated CO2 from the O2 drop.
For me I wanted direct measures of CO2 and O2, so the vernier worked out okay.  The response time on the CO2 detector is lousy (minutes).  Accurate calibration was also not straight forward.  It just assumes background is 400ppm for air.  If however its not (bear in mind the meter takes 15 mins to equilibrate), thats essentially the % error on the other measurements.
I found the best way for accurate measurements was simply to create your own CO2 standards and do your own calibration.
The O2 meter is fast responding, but requires its own care (needs to be kept upright).
I had some dealings with their customer support about the functionality of their detectors.  They responded quickly and in detail.
I wanted to know if I could use their ethanol meter to measure my blood alcohol by exhaled breath.  They gave me the honest answer which was 'kinda' but they were fuzzy on the details about the response of the meter to different humidities and temperatures.  That still shows they are aware of the limits of their machines and are not simply BS 'ours is the best' salesmen.",living without eating for NINE YEARS' BUSTED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwOX7vOf0_s,5,,0,1747,2104223,46140,2766,0,18920,2172049

It could be possible that one day, billions of years from now, the Earth will stand still. But chances are good that other events that will occur before that, such as the sun swallowing up the planet. With that being said, there isn’t a chance that the Earth will suddenly stop spinning anytime soon. But let’s just assume for a moment that the Earth did suddenly stop rotating, and take a look at what would happen to us, and the planet. 

Our planet spins at its equator 1000 miles per hour as it orbits the sun. But, as you get closer to the poles, the rotation is slower. Without this rotation, life as we know it wouldn’t be possible. It is said that billions of years ago, our planet used to spin much faster than it does now. In the beginning of our young solar system, an unknown planet or large celestial body collided with the Earth, and in that collision, the Earths alignment and rotation were changed, and the moon was formed. Since then the Earth’s rotation has been slowing down. It is said that the moon used to also spin faster than it does now before it became tidally locked with the Earth. 

Tidal locking is the name given to the situation when a moon or planetary object’s orbital period matches its rotational period. Coincidentally, it is the same fate that affects every single large moon orbiting a planet. A great example of this is our own Moon. 
In our early Solar System, both the Earth and the Moon rotated independently of each other. 

But the Earth’s gravity grabbed onto the tidal bulges and slowed down the rotation of the Moon. To compensate for the loss of momentum in the system, the Moon drifted away from the Earth to its current position, about 230,000 miles away.",What Would Happen If The Earth Stopped Spinning? | Unveiled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_T7L8rt1Ec,5,,0,466,10897122,68993,6243,0,14324,10986682

So how does a $40,000 car come down to a price of $29,450? 

To start, this car is eligible for a $3750 federal tax credit until June 30th, 2019. This means if you pay more than $3750 in federal taxes, you will receive this entire amount back at the time you file your tax return. That money is as good as cash.

California drivers are also eligible for a $2500 Electric Vehicle Rebate, in which the state will mail you a check for $2500 upon showing proof of purchase. 

Now Tesla gets a little sneaky after this…because in that $29,450 figure, Tesla also 


So excluding the gas savings and only focusing on the first two, cash-value rebates, the ACTUAL price of the car comes to $33,750. For a brand new Tesla. Standard Range Plus. With AutoPilot. 

So here’s how I bought this car for $78.39 per month:

Because I financed 100% of the car, my ONLY out of pocket cost was the taxes, license, and registration - which came to $4437.01

From the remaining amount I financed, my payment comes to $640 per month, or $7680 in the first year. 

That means, in the first year, my total out of pocket cost is $12,117.01 between my payments, taxes, insurance, etc. 

However, after the rebates and tax credits, that brings my TOTAL cost of owning this car for the first year down to $5867.01. 

Because this car is for business use, the $1438 I pay in interest on the auto loan is a tax write off, the $4437 in taxes, licensing, and registration I paid upfront is a write off, and I can depreciate the car against my income. That’s a $14,075 tax write off…which saves me roughly about $4,926.25 in taxes. 

So remember…my total out of pocket cost was $5867.01 after electric vehicle tax incentives. PLUS I save $4926.25 in taxes…that means I’m effectively buying a BRAND new Tesla Model 3 for $78.39 per month out of pocket…and realistically, this works out to be a FREE car when you take into account that MOST of that $640 per month loan payment goes towards principle, and that I can invest my money in real estate at a significantly higher return than what I’m paying in interest on the Tesla. But in terms of out of pocket cost: $78.39 per month. 

And after going through the experience buying a Tesla like this, completely sight unseen, without ever having driven one before, I have to say…I don’t understand the concern of Tesla’s no-dealership model. Personally, I think the entire worry is overblown - and I think we’ll start to see a lot MORE car companies embracing this online-only business model. 

We’re naturally entering an era where everything is done online. I haven’t been to a mall or physical store in FOREVER because it’s more convenient to buy it online, and USUALLY for a more competitive price because online stores have lower overhead, and that savings is passed down to the customer. 

And for that, I have to give Tesla credit for being the first to really challenge the traditional business model of selling cars.

However, they're involved in one or two court cases of interest to secularists like myself.  At the time of this presentation, I didn't realize I was actually praising the efforts of two separate groups. So there need be some clarification.  The devil worshippers successfully sued for the right to hold their black mass in the Oklahoma City Civic Center. They also backed The Satanic Temple, (a non-theist group with no affiliation) in a separate suit over placement of a monument to the Ten Commandments. The Satanic Temple is trying to erect a statue of Baphomet right next to it. Who would have guessed that two different Satanic organizations would have challenged the state in the same courthouse at the same time?

It is also a timely presentation, considering that a religious zealot just decapitated an Oklahoma teen for ""practicing witchcraft"".

On a landline, it could be anyone, says privacy activist Christopher Soghoian, because surveillance backdoors are built into the phone system by default, to allow governments to listen in. But then again, so could a foreign intelligence service ... or a criminal. Which is why, says Soghoian, some tech companies are resisting governments' call to build the same backdoors into mobile phones and new messaging systems. Learn how some tech companies are working to keep your calls and messages private.

chemtrails,"Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies. | Daryl Davis | TEDxNaperville by TEDx Talks 1 year ago 18 minutes 3,795,820 views","A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.

Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.

In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.

Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.

Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel. Today´s video will be the beginning of a video series about the amazing supersonic commercial airliner CONCORDE. 

First and most importantly I want to thank the Brooklands museum, the home of British motorsport and aviation, for inviting me to there fantastic site. 
How could I resist in making a video about the airplane that got me all excited about aviation as a little boy? 

I want to thank all volunteers at the Brooklands museum for showing around and providing me with access to all their facilities. Therefore I want to donate all the earnings made with the upcoming series to the volunteers at Brooklands. Without your help and work, this marvel of aviation history would otherwise be consigned to the history books. 

I hope you enjoy this tour around Concorde and make sure to watch the follow up videos to this series. 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

—————————————————————————————————— 

Dear friends and followers,welcome back to my channel! Today's video will all be about ""WHAT IS A SQUAWK CODE, and what is it good for?""
As you get your IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) departure clearance, the ATC controller will give you a pre assigned four decimal code. After acknowledging the clearance you use the little numbered keyboard on your transponder to enter the give four decimal code and depending on your airline or airport procedure you set the transponder to the AUTO position. Meaning your transponder is set and ready to transmit that code and that code you´ve just set that´s the so called squawk code. 
So as take off, and the transponder comes fully active you turn up on the ATC controllers radar screen, but it won´t just be a blip indicating your airplane is in the air, it will also show the 4 digit squawk code, your current altitude plus your callsign. As you are now under radar control, the ATC controller can also look up your flight plan, so he knows where you´re flying to, the amount of passengers, crew, and fuel you have on board, and much more. 

Now depending on the airplane size and manufacturer, the transponder can come in different modes. For instance, little Cessnas or other smaller aircraft within the General Aviation category don´t necessarily need a transponder which transmits the airplanes´ altitude. Therefore a mode“Alfa"" transponder will do the job, meaning it will only transmit the airplanes position and squawk code. 
But be aware the places where you can fly without an altitude reporting transponder are becoming less and less.
To be on the safer side, your plane has to have a Mode ""Charlie"" transponder which transmits the planes´ position and its barometric altitude and squawk code. Obviously, those are a little bit more expensive, but the ATC controllers and other pilots benefit from investment and adding a TCAS system to it, you´ll feel a whole lot safer when flying around on weekends where the airspace is packed with weekend warriors.
And as just shown before a mode Sierra transponder, which is above all other transponder modes and can also be used for data link messaging.

But more to see within the video. 

The preset codes you have to memorize for are 

7500 Hijacking
Seven Five - Man with a knife 

7600 Loss of communications 
Seven Six I need my radio fixed 

7700 Emergency 
Seven Seven - I´m falling from heaven 

The follow up video about the Transponder and it´s buttons and switches will follow soon. 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

We do a little behavior research of our own, and discover what scientists continue to learn from the world’s most famous experiment in domestication. The fox experiment continues under the supervision of Lyudmila Trut at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics. Her book “How to Tame a Fox (and Build a Dog)”, co-authored by Lee Alan Dugatkin, details the history and science behind the experiment.

On February 14, 2018, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing seventeen students and staff members and injuring seventeen others. Witnesses identified nineteen-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz as the assailant, and he was arrested in Coral Springs by the Broward County Sheriff's Office shortly after he escaped the scene; Cruz had purchased food at Walmart and McDonald's restaurants after leaving the scene of the shooting. Cruz confessed to being the perpetrator, and he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Police and prosecutors have not yet offered a motive and are investigating ""a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior"".

It is the deadliest shooting at a high school in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that took place on April 20, 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control following attacks in Las Vegas, Nevada and Sutherland Springs, Texas respectively in October and November 2017.

The sheriff's office received a number of tips in 2016 and 2017 about Cruz's threats to carry out a school shooting. The FBI learned that a YouTube user with the username ""nikolas cruz"" posted a message in September 2017 about becoming a school shooter, but the agency could not identify the user. In January 2018, someone contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tip line with a direct complaint that Cruz had made a death threat, but the complaint was not forwarded to the local FBI office.

The blog also reports that the law firm representing these people (Baum, Hedlund, Aristei & Goldman) have emails that show ‘Monsanto’s efforts to marshal scientists in defence of its products and combat research at odds with its own’. Kyle begins his video by reading a section from The WSJ’s blog post before showing us just how much in-depth research he has done on the subject before deciding to sit down to make a video.

Gear down, three green and let´s get started! 

So let´s look at the different types of landing gears. The most common one out there is the single axle landing gear with a tyre fitted on each side mounted to a large strut. Mostly used on passenger jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. 
With increasing weight, you need more surface, so more tyres to evenly distribute the weight of the aircraft. 
So if we look at the main landing gear of the Boeing 757, you have the main landing gear strut, which by the way is filled with nitrogen acting as a spring force and hydraulic fluids for dampening. Then you have the truck or boogie, and four tires in tandem pairs. But more importantly, for today´s topic, you see this little hydraulic actuator right here, the so-called truck positioning actuator aka the tilt actuator. This little actuator is attached aft of the main gear strut and pushes the rear wheels downwards forcing the forward wheels to move upwards as the truck is axially mounted to the main strut. 
As the plane comes in for landing, the rear wheels touch-down first. The actuator holds up against the pushing force, otherwise, the rear tires could bounce up, slamming the forward tires into the ground. Once the weight of the plane presses the tires onto ground, a pressure relief valve opens up and the actuator collapses letting both tires touch down. This all happens in the split of a second. Once the actuator is fully compressed, so weight on wheels, it triggers the air/ground sensing unit from air to ground before the nose wheel has touched down, automatically extending the ground spoilers and allowing thrust reverser deployment and depressurizing the aircraft etc. 

But see more in the video 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

chemtrails,"The Big Quake - TechKnow by Al Jazeera English 2 years ago 24 minutes 70,685 views","The 1,130km stretch of coastline from Vancouver, Canada to Mendocino, California, harbours an underwater threat just over 110km offshore - the seismic fault, Cascadia. 

Places like Japan, Chile and North America's Pacific Northwest all fall in what's known as subduction zones - ie, where one tectonic plate dives under another.

The potential seismic activity from one of these plates 'popping' from on top of the other equates to an entire region affected by earthquake symptoms. 

The Cascadia Initiative (CI) is a years-long project that has been developed to study the effects of the fault and the two plates responsible for the action: Juan de Fuca and Gorda.

From the data collected, it is confirmed that the Cascadia will only cause large magnitude earthquakes, ranging between every 300 to 500 years. 

The last noted eruption of the Cascadia was in the 1700s, making the Pacific Northwest overdue for the next quake.

But alongside the shaking, the movement of the sea floor is also set to generate a tsunami wave that will reach Northwestern shores within minutes of the explosion.

Impact studies are under way at Oregon State University, where civil engineer Daniel Cox utilises a wave laboratory to gauge the effect of different sized tsunamis.

Replicas of towns based on actual layouts of coastal cities that could be affected by a Cascadia-triggered tsunami are used to collect data that is then input into a computer, simulating potential situations and scanning for the worst areas of damage.

The results, even on a small scale, are terrifying, and the fear doesn't lie only in the force of the tsunami waves, but also in the projectiles that get swept up in it, including vehicles or temporary buildings that could crash and, ultimately, obliterate permanent structures.

With knowledge of the mass panic caused during evacuation due to natural disasters, even this facet of the event has been mapped out by experts at Oregon State. Combining elements of how the water moves onto land and factoring in human behaviour leads to the conclusion that most people are still unaware of how to react should an event of this large scale arise. 

How likely is it that there will be a 9.0 magnitude earthquake on the Pacific Northwest within the next 50 years?

""Somewhere within one in seven chance within the next 50 years,"" says Daniel Cox. ""These odds are way too high for us to accept. There's too many lives at risk. We have to come up with some better ideas.""

This experience takes us on a journey to the end of time, trillions of years into the future, to discover what the fate of our planet and our universe may ultimately be. 

We start in 2019 and travel exponentially through time, witnessing the future of Earth, the death of the sun, the end of all stars, proton decay, zombie galaxies, possible future civilizations, exploding black holes, the effects of dark energy, alternate universes, the final fate of the cosmos - to name a few.

This is a picture of the future as painted by modern science - a picture that will surely evolve over time as we dig for more clues to how our story will unfold. Much of the science is very recent - and new puzzle pieces are still waiting to be found.

To me, this overhead view of time gives a profound perspective - that we are living inside the hot flash of the Big Bang, the perfect moment to soak in the sights and sounds of a universe in its glory days, before it all fades away.  Although the end will eventually come, we have a practical infinity of time to play with if we play our cards right. The future may look bleak, but we have enormous potential as a species.

Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against historical sources, Aslan describes a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity secret; and the seditious “King of the Jews,” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his lifetime. Aslan explores why the early Church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary and grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself.

Sodom And Gomorrah – the names of these two Biblical cities have long since become bywords for sexual immorality and licentious behaviour. Home of excess and wickedness, they were destroyed by a vengeful God under a hail of fire and brimstone. However, most people regard the story as a metaphorical warning against sin as no strong archaeological evidence for the existence of Sodom and Gomorrah has been found – until now... 

Increasingly sophisticated technology has enabled Mike Sanders to make out artificial structures on the bed of the Dead Sea. He believes he can prove that not only are they the relics of the two cities, but also that they were probably destroyed in a catastrophe about 5,000 years ago, the ruins hidden by the advancing waters of the Dead Sea. In Sodom And Gomorrah we follow him as he dives into the depths of the sea and searches for more tantalising clues.

==============

Issue number one: Radiation.

Outside our protective magnetic sphere, space is a shooting gallery of solar radiation and cosmic rays that would wreak havoc on our bodies to a level that right now we can only speculate.

And then there’s the 18 months you would spend on Mars, which doesn’t have a magnetosphere and a very thin atmosphere.

Humans have never been exposed to this type of radiation for this long. It’s a problem we’ve never dealt with before, and it’s going to be a huge challenge to overcome.

Number two: Extremely low air pressure.

The Martian atmosphere has only 1% of the air pressure of Earth.

Walking outside on Mars is not that much different from walking on the moon, from a life support systems perspective.

The thin atmosphere is also a nightmare for landing on Mars.

That’s why smaller rovers like Spirit and Opportunity used bizarre air bag systems to land and Curiosity, which was much heavier, had to use a combination of parachutes, thrusters, and a cable system to get there safely.

So SpaceX’s vertical propulsive landing option is probably best for Mars, but this is something that’s never been done up to this point, so it’s hard to know what challenges there are in attempting this with the thinner atmosphere and lower gravity.

Number 3: Perchlorates in the soil

In the Biosphere 2 project, they grew their own food and struggled to have enough for everyone to eat. When they emerged at the end, many were malnourished and emaciated.

In 2008, the Mars Phoenix lander found significant quantities of perchlorate in the Martian soil.

Perchlorates are salt compounds that are often used in rocket propellants and they’re extremely harmful for humans.

They interrupt the thyroid gland and prevent the body from absorbing iodine, which leads to aplastic anemia.

That’s when your bone marrow can’t make new red blood cells. Red blood cells are what carry oxygen through the body. Minor problem.

Or, if aplastic anemia isn’t your thing, you might get agranulocytosis, which prevents your body from making white blood cells.

Chris McKay at the Ames Research Center said that if your backyard had this much perchlorate in the soil, it would be considered a superfund site. 

Basically Mars is a giant toxic waste dump.

Number 4: The gravity problem

Mars is smaller than Earth, with gravity only 38% of that you’re used to here. An average 150 pound person on Earth would weigh only 57 pounds on Mars.

We do have some idea of what to expect from long-term zero gravity thanks to astronauts like Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, who just this year completed a year-long space mission.

Although the record was set in 1995 by Valery Polyakov, who flew on the Mir space station for 437 days.

And last but not least, number 5: The Contamination Problem

We’ve talked in videos about the Fermi Paradox and the Drake Equation in the search for intelligent life in the universe. 

Because if life could form twice in one solar system, the potential for life in other solar systems, and intelligent life, becomes very significant.

So one of the biggest problems when it comes to traveling to Mars is that we’re not just bringing ourselves… We’re bringing our microbes.

The second we land on Mars, we have contaminated it.",5 Reasons Going To Mars is a TERRIBLE Idea | Answers With Joe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESQ1bKd7Los,5,,0,918,1116486,23194,3528,0,8901,1152109

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel. Today´s video will be the beginning of a video series about the amazing supersonic commercial airliner CONCORDE. 

First and most importantly I want to thank the Brooklands museum, the home of British motorsport and aviation, for inviting me to there fantastic site. 
How could I resist in making a video about the airplane that got me all excited about aviation as a little boy? 

I want to thank all volunteers at the Brooklands museum for showing around and providing me with access to all their facilities. Therefore I want to donate all the earnings made with the upcoming series to the volunteers at Brooklands. Without your help and work, this marvel of aviation history would otherwise be consigned to the history books. 

I hope you enjoy this tour around Concorde and make sure to watch the follow up videos to this series. 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

Dear friends and followers welcome back to my channel and to a great video about the famous MAYDAY and PAN PAN call. 
We´ll be looking at why and when pilots use these calls. 

First off the definition of MAYDAY: 

Mayday is an emergency procedure word used internationally as a distress signal in voice-procedure radio communications.

It is used to signal a life-threatening emergency primarily by aviators and mariners, but in some countries local organizations such as firefighters, police forces, and transportation organizations also use the term. The call is always given three times in a row (""Mayday mayday mayday"") to prevent its being mistaken for some similar-sounding phrase under noisy conditions, and to distinguish an actual mayday call from a message about a mayday call.

The ""mayday"" procedure word was originated in 1923, by a senior radio officer at Croydon Airport in London. The officer, Frederick Stanley Mockford, was asked to think of a word that would indicate distress and would easily be understood by all pilots and ground staff in an emergency. Since much of the traffic at the time was between Croydon and Le Bourget Airport in Paris, he proposed the expression ""mayday"" from the French m'aider ('help me'), a shortened form of venez m'aider ('come and help me').It is unrelated to the holiday May Day.

Before the voice call ""mayday"", SOS was the Morse code equivalent of the mayday call. In 1927, the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington adopted the voice call mayday as the radiotelephone distress call in place of the SOS radiotelegraph (Morse code) call.

PAN PAN call definition: 
The radiotelephony message PAN-PAN is the international standard urgency signal that someone aboard a boat, ship, aircraft, or other vehicle uses to declare that they have a situation that is urgent, but for the time being, does not pose an immediate danger to anyone's life or to the vessel itself. This is referred to as a state of urgency. This is distinct from a mayday call (distress signal), which means that there is an imminent danger to life or to the continued viability of the vessel itself Radioing pan-pan informs potential rescuers (including emergency services and other craft in the area) that an urgent problem exists, whereas mayday calls on them to drop all other activities and immediately begin a rescue.

The exact representation of PAN-PAN in Morse code is the urgency signal XXX, which was first defined by the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927.

But see more in the video on how they are being used accordingly! 

Thank you very much for your time! I hope you enjoy this video!
Wishing you all the best!

chemtrails,"Bill Gates-Backed Carbon Capture Plant Does The Work Of 40 Million Trees by CNBC 16 hours ago 14 minutes 492,157 views","In Squamish, British Columbia, there’s a company that wants to stop climate change by sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

It’s called Carbon Engineering, and it uses a combination of giant fans and complex chemical processes to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a procedure known as Direct Air Capture.

Direct Air Capture isn’t new, but Carbon Engineering says its technology has advanced enough for it to finally make financial sense.

The company is backed by Bill Gates — but also by the oil giants Chevron, BHP, and Occidental. These partnerships will bring Carbon Engineering’s tech to market by using the captured carbon to make synthetic fuels and and help extract more oil from the ground.

Will Carbon Engineering’s technology decrease the amount of CO2 in the air, or is it going to prolong our dependence on fossil fuels?

Equinox brings us this investigation of a mystery that is baffling Egyptologists. The case calls into question whole areas of accepted scientific fact from botany, through chemistry to archaeology. In 1992, routine tests on a mummy in a Munich museum revealed high body levels of cocaine and nicotine. But such substances were not available in ancient Egypt, coming as they do from the Americas – not, apparently, to be “discovered” for thousands of years after the passing of the Egyptian dynasties. Are the mummies fakes; were the substances from plants that have since disappeared or were there, in fact, trade routes between Egypt and South America that predate accepted chronology?

They held radically different views about their leader – his identity, his message and his vision of the future. One of those factions flourished under the guiding genius of St Paul – and eventually wrote its version of the story in the Gospels of the New Testament. The other faction withered and died away, leaving behind no written records. But what if the losers in this power struggle had written their version of the story? The Real Jesus Christ reconstructs that lost biography of Jesus: an alternative version of his life as it would have been told by those who lost the battle for the succession, but who knew him better than anyone else – his closest followers and his family.

John's book ""High Tide On Main Street: Rising Sea Level and the Coming Coastal Crisis"" is available to buy now: https://geni.us/wQ41O1m

Rising sea level will permanently alter coastlines and is perhaps the most profound long-term aspect of climate change affecting coastal communities everywhere, as well as the global economy. The phenomenon is often overshadowed by short-term flood events, though it will elevate those too. In this talk, oceanographer and author John Englander highlights some surprising scientific aspects of sea level rise, including the latest projections for the coming decades, eventually many meters above present.

Watch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/TFMGyvHJrX8

John Englander is an oceanographer, consultant and leading expert on sea level rise. His broad marine science background coupled with explorations to Greenland and Antarctica allows him to see the big picture of sea level rise and its revolutionary impacts.

This talk was filmed at the Ri on 11 February 2019.

Dr Michael Shermer begins by saying that 84% of the world's population believe in some kind of organised religion and how do those who believe in a particular religion know that they have chosen the right one and everyone else has got it wrong?

He proceeds to explain two pieces of evidence that proves that humans made up God and religion and not the other way around. He starts with evolutionary theory saying that we are all descendants from cautious creatures who creator false positive rather than false negatives. 
The creation of an agency (an omnipotent being) within a religion is a powerful force of social control. Then the second line of evidence is the what ever social environment were born into we would be exposed to the dominant religion in that environment i.e. India -- Hinduism, Europe -- Christianity.

Over the past two centuries, archaeologists have found bones, footprints, and artifacts showing that people like ourselves have existed on earth for many millions of years. But many scientists have forgotten or ignored these remarkable facts. Why? Primarily because they contradict the now dominant evolutionary views about human origins and antiquity. According to these views, humans like ourselves have existed for only about 100,000 or 200,000 years, and before that there were only more primitive human ancestors. This evolutionary paradigm, to which influential groups of scientists are deeply committed, has acted as a ""knowledge filter."" And the filtering, intentional or not, has left us with a radically incomplete set of facts for building our ideas about human origins. Recovering the complete set of facts takes us on a fascinating expedition, across five continents to various archaeological sites, some long forgotten, some the center of ongoing controversy. On the other hand, the complete set of facts is consistent with the accounts of extreme human antiquity found in the Puranas, the historical writings of ancient India.

Bio:
Michael A. Cremo is research associate in history of archeology. He is a member of the World Archaeological Congress (WAC) since 1993. His WAC3 paper ""Puranic Time and the Archaeological Record"" was published in the Routledge One World Archaeology series volume Time and Archaeology (1999), edited by Tim Murray. He is also a member of the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA). In 2004 Cremo's paper ""The Later Discoveries of Boucher de Perthes at Moulin Quignon and Their Impact on the Moulin Quignon Jaw Controversy,"" presented at the XXth International Congress for History of Science, Liege, Belgium, was published in a conference proceedings volume of this congress, by the scientific publisher Brepols.

Cremo is the principal author of the book Forbidden Archeology, a comprehensive historical survey of archaeological anomalies. In a review in British Journal for History of Science, Tim Murray said the book ""provides the historian of archaeology with a useful compendium of case studies in the history and sociology of scientific knowledge, which can be used to foster debate within archaeology about how to describe the epistemology of one's discipline.""

Cremo is particularly interested in examining the history of the archeology from the standpoint of alternative worldviews, particularly worldviews with foundations in ancient Indian thought. He has given invited lectures on his work at the Royal Institution in London, the anthropology department of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, the archeology department of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, and many other scientific institutions. He has also lectured on his work at universities throughout the world.","Michael Cremo: ""Forbidden Archaeology"" | Talks at Google",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKfGC3P9KoQ,5,,0,3970,1090392,7337,1455,0,3148,1102332

We see it everywhere in the world around us. But, did you know that you can also hear it in your favorite music?

Since the beginning of time Phi—also known as the golden ratio—has inspired the world around us. Have you ever noticed how some pieces of music just seem to make sense? From the notes and chords to the phrasing and dynamics, they can all feel like they were meant to go together. Many people believe this is not a coincidence but the golden ratio in action. Hosts Nahre and LA explore this phenomenon and create their own composition inspired by the golden ratio.

As astronomer Tabetha Boyajian investigated this perplexing celestial object, a colleague suggested something unusual: Could it be an alien-built megastructure? Such an extraordinary idea would require extraordinary evidence. In this talk, Boyajian gives us a look at how scientists search for and test hypotheses when faced with the unknown.

Nobody knows how our world will look like in 25 years. Perhaps our work is taken over by autonomous robots and we become the slaves of the technology we have created ourselves. The big questions about the future of man and his relation to technology are presented to two important thinkers of the moment: Kevin Kelly and Yuval Noah Harari.
Kevin Kelly is a writer of influential works such as What Technology Wants and The Inevitable. Kelly sketches the inevitability of technology and even sees technology as an autonomous evolutionary system. Artificial intelligence becomes commonplace for everyone and will help us analyze difficult issues and challenge them to reflect on who we are. Kelly is convinced that we are already seen as Gods by technology and that robots will also believe in their own Gods.
Yuval Noah Harari is a writer of books about the history of Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus. Harari sketches the history of tomorrow and analyzes the way in which we create our own illusions; illusory institutions such as religion, states and money. We believe in gods because we want to be them ourselves. Harari sees a society with inequalities where some people can upgrade themselves to gods and others will remain vulnerable and mortal.

chemtrails,"The Sacred City (Religious Documentary) | Timeline by Timeline - World History Documentaries 4 months ago 1 hour, 25 minutes 215,599 views","The Sacred City presents compelling evidence that suggests the holy city of Mecca is in the wrong location and that the worlds 1.6 billion Muslims are praying in the direction of the wrong city. Compiling evidence from both historic sources and new technologies point to the correct location in this seismic, revelatory new film.

In this startling and original documentary, writer and historian, Dan Gibson, shows that descriptions of Mohamed’s original holy city – as detailed in the Qur’an and Islamic histories, do not match that of the Mecca we know today.  If true this could shake Islam to it’s roots, because every Muslim is required to pray towards  the ‘forbidden gathering place’. If Dan Gibson is right, Muslims are praying in the wrong direction.

In the film ‘The Sacred City’ we set out his evidence from within Islamic and ancient histories – while also using modern technologies -  to track down the biggest secret of the last fifteen hundred years. Gibson not only finds the location of the original Mecca but also provides a convincing argument as to how such a great misunderstanding in Islamic history came about.

While clearly controversial, The Sacred City is respectful of Islam’s prophet, and does not dispute the events of the Qur’an; but shows how a deliberate attempt was made to hide from Islam, secrets that impact every Muslim today. The evidence is compelling and fascinating.

In a time when the world agenda is being set by Islam, it is more important than ever for the origins and history of this world religion to be examined afresh. This is an important documentary with world-wide appeal for both religious and secular audiences.

Beautifully filmed in the ruins and deserts of the middle east, the film is a detective story that investigates the dawn of Islam and will become the most talked about film for years to come.

The people who believe in this conspiracy theory call these lines in the sky ‘chemtrails’ and feel so strongly against them that back in May of this year, they organised protests around the world. In an attempt to better understand this conspiracy and the people who believe in it, I attended one of the protests in London. 

As I was working my way through the crowd I saw a young gentleman holding a cardboard sign saying “stop #Geoengineering” made out of print-outs of contrails pictures. Within seconds of talking to him, I was reminded of my nerdy teenage self and, for some time, was seriously considering not publishing the interview but out of all the people I met there that day what he had to say was the most interesting. In the very short time I talked to him there was a whole load of crazy that I am going to address later, but for now, I am going to concentrate on the parts centered around depopulation and #SpacePreservationAct that some says proves #Chemtrails existence.

But could they have aesthetic value? Autonomous systems expert Raffaello D'Andrea develops flying machines, and his latest projects are pushing the boundaries of autonomous flight — from a flying wing that can hover and recover from disturbance to an eight-propeller craft that's ambivalent to orientation ... to a swarm of tiny coordinated micro-quadcopters. Prepare to be dazzled by a dreamy, swirling array of flying machines as they dance like fireflies above the TED stage.

chemtrails,"The Secrets Of Quantum Physics (Full Astrophysics Documentary) | Spark by Spark 1 year ago 58 minutes 1,191,615 views","Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.

The story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.

Albert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?

Elsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics – The Uncertainty Principle – is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?

Transcript:
I lost over 100 pounds, a third of my weight. I was probably at my heaviest. You don’t ever weigh yourself at your heaviest but I was probably over 340, certainly around there. And now as I sit here in front of you I’m probably about 232. There’s a fluctuation of a couple of pounds, it goes back and forth. That’s a lot of weight. And I did not lose it for vanity. I was pretty happy with myself fat. I didn’t mind being fat. It wasn’t a big deal to me. I didn’t mind how I looked. But my health was getting bad. 

I didn’t even mind how I felt very much. I didn’t mind not being energetic and stuff. But I started having blood pressure that was stupid high like, you know, like English voltage, like 220 even on blood pressure medicine. And I have two young children. I’m an old dad. My daughter was born when I was 50. So I’m 61 now.

And my life expectancy, the actuary tables were crashing down and the doctor said that I had to get a stomach sleeve. It was a wonderful moment because it then gave me the option to go crazy. If you’re going to surgically do something to me to stop me from swallowing that means I don’t have to worry about doing a sane diet. I can get nutty. And being given the option to be nutty was all I needed. I realized that not only am I not good at moderation, I also don’t respect moderation. Anyone I know who’s able to do moderation I don’t like them. 

The people I respect and love are people that go wild. I mean I don’t want to go into Kerouac here but the mad ones. No one brags about climbing a nice little slope. You brag about climbing Everest. So once my friend Ray Cronise who I can Cray Ray, once Cray Ray told me that I could lose the weight but it was going to be really hard, it got really easy. Once you make something a challenge, you make something I can brag about, I can do it.

Quantum Gravity Research is a Los Angeles based team of mathematicians and physicists working on developing a theoretical framework for a first-principles unified quantum gravity theory they call emergence theory. Still in the early stage of development, emergence theory attempts to unify, through mathematical and scientific rigor, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness.

This film is presented in layperson terms and explains basics tenets of emergence theory, quantum mechanics and digital physics in ways that are meant to be communicative and fun. However, if you'd like to read any of the scientific and more technical papers, please visit our website.

chemtrails,"NYC grid explained by Tech Insider 3 years ago 2 minutes, 25 seconds 62,141 views","In the early 19th century, John Randel Jr. set about planning what would become the gridded street plan of Manhattan. Randel spent ten years walking the entirety of the city, marking each future intersection with either a bolt or marble monument. Two hundred years later, one of the bolts still survives in a hidden spot in Central Park.

chemtrails,"Holm Gero Hümmler: Chemtrails - zwischen Meteorologie und rechter Verschwörungstheorie by Skeptics in the Pub Wien 3 years ago 1 hour, 3 minutes 10,648 views","Die Chemtrails-Theorie hat in den vergangenen Jahren zunehmende Bedeutung in Teilen der rechtsextremen Szene. Sie behauptet, dass verschiedene Regierungen systematisch Chemikalien in der hohen Atmosphäre versprühen lassen, um damit die globale Erwärmung zu reduzieren oder andere geheime Ziele zu erreichen. Als Indiz hierfür werden Flugzeug-Kondensstreifen angeführt, die sich nicht wie gewohnt in wenigen Minuten auflösen, sondern sich ausdehnen und in dünne Wolkendecken übergehen. Viele der angeführten Phänomene lassen sich jedoch einfach als meteorologische Erscheinungen oder Fehlinterpretationen von Fachinformationen erklären.

Der Vortrag beginnt bei 5:20, die Diskussion bei 41:40.

VORTRAGENDER
Dr. Holm Gero Hümmler, Geschäftsführer einer mittelständischen Unternehmensberatung, studierte Physik mit Nebenfach Meteorologie an der Universität Frankfurt und Betriebswirtschaft an der FernUniversität Hagen. Bis zu seinem Wechsel in die Wirtschaft forschte er am Max-Planck-Institut für Physik in München, dem CERN in Genf und dem Brookhaven National Laboratory. Interessengebiete innerhalb der GWUP sind Grenzgebiete der Physik sowie die Öffentlichkeitsarbeit.

First off we have some observations from YouTuber Planet X Hunter, followed by a lesson from the world leading expert on the Nibiru group, Sam Hofman.

Is this all real, or one of the most far out conspiracies of our time?  I'll give you a clue.  It's the latter.

chemtrails,"Zeitgeist: Moving Forward (Peter Joseph) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History by Reel Truth History Documentaries 2 months ago 2 hours, 39 minutes 497,648 views","Zeitgeist: Moving Forward focuses on the very fabric of the social order: Monetary-Market Economics. The majority of the world today have come to see basic flaws in the economic system we share. Large scale debt defaults, inflation, industrial pollution, resource depletion, rising cancer rates and other signposts have emerged to bring the concern into the realm of “public health”. The tendency is to demand reform in one area or another, avoiding the possibility that perhaps the entire system is intrinsically flawed at the foundational level. Part One presents a treatment on “Human Nature”, with the argument that society is out of line with what Science has taught us about positive human development, enabling distortions of health and behaviour that could be thwarted if the social system was changed. Part Two details the central inherent flaws of the Monetary-Market System of economic conduct and how this system is destroying ourselves and the planet in a very direct way. Part Three begins a thought exercise where the Earth and Natural Law is considered a starting point for human decision-making rather than politics, with the subject explored from all sides. Part Four ends with a prediction of what is to come as the society becomes more destabilised due to our outdated traditional practices.

The concept was brought to popularity by former BBC sports writer and self-proclaimed “son of God”, David Icke in his 1999 book The Biggest Secret: The Book That Will Change the World. In the book, Icke posits that society is controlled by humanoid reptiles. For the sake of simplicity, we will call them the Reptilians. While it may sound like a wildly outlandish conspiracy theory, approximately 12 million Americans believe that it’s actually true and there is a conspiracy against humans perpetrated by the Reptilians.

Dear friends and followers, in today´s video I´ll be explaining, why pilots say ""Heavy"" at the end of their callsign. 
I´m sure many of you have listened to LIVE ATC conversations here on youtube, and ever so often you can hear the controller and the pilot communicate with each other and the pilot always ends by saying his callsign and ""Heavy"" at the end. 
The ""Heavy"" is related to the ICAO wake turbulence categories. As all flying objects create turbulent air in their path, airplanes create so-called wake turbulence. And the heavier and the greater the angle of attack is the stronger the wake turbulence become. Therefore it´s absolutely vital that airplanes keep a safe distance to each other so to not enter the turbulence of the preceding plane. 
Cause of that matter the ICAO came up with a wake turbulence weight category chart. 
But see more about the minimum separations etc. in the video :) 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

chemtrails,"What Actually Causes Dandruff? by Veritasium 7 months ago 9 minutes, 2 seconds 1,088,815 views","This fungus lives on your scalp and may affect the genes you express.
Check out Head & Shoulders research on getting rid of dandruff: https://ve42.co/HS

Animation by Pindex: https://ve42.co/pindex

When I started this project, I wasn't sure what caused dandruff and I also didn't think much science would go into making a shampoo like Head & Shoulders. So what I learned really surprised me:

There are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.

In fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.

Dear friends and followers welcome back to my channel!
Have you ever wondered why some airplanes get a water salute? I must admit it´s a rare occasion but the tradition is spread out throughout the world, but it´s not the airline industry who started with this salute. It goes way back when ocean liners were setting off on their maiden voyage overseas. Firefighting boats would line up next to the brand new ship and spray water fountains next to it whilst leaving the harbour. 
So in the 1990´s,  Salt Lake City Airport would start spraying water arches over retiring Delta airline captains after their last landing. And that´s how it all started. But see more in the video! 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel. Today´s topic is one of the most ask passenger question, ""Can a passenger land a plane?"". There are so many rumours about this question, it´s just not true. 

So a few facts. My friend Carolin, has no connection to the aviation world besides from flying to holiday once in a while, obviously as a passenger. 
Now as soon as she sat down, the hardest part was establishing a communication between her and me, the ATC controller. Carolin was totally overwhelmed with all the switches and buttons, that it took nearly 20 minutes to find the push to talk button. In a real-life situation, if a plane does not respond within 20 minutes, fighter jets will be on their way intercepting the aeroplane as it causes a potential threat to national security, depending which land you´re flying across. 

Once communication was established, I had to give her instructions on how to set up the approach phase for an automatic landing, better known as AUTOLAND procedure. The AUTOLAND allows pilots to perform a fully automated landing in bad visual conditions, known as CAT3 approaches. More about that in future videos. 
Once the approach set up was completed, I had to give her instructions to familiarize with important levers and switches, such as the landing gear lever, the flaps, flight control computer and much more. 
Later I guided her via radar vectors towards the airport, constantly descending and reducing the speed accordingly. 

But see for yourself. 

My opinion if a passenger can land a plane. I´ll be honest with you! It´s impossible! We needed three attempts to just establish basic communication and Carolin accidentally brought the aircraft into a stall. Don´t ask how! 
And she was pretty nervous, although she knew it was a simulator. Imagine the anxiety in a real plane!?

I know that there are many videos out there where apparently the passenger landed the plane, but all of the passengers had some kind of flying background. And the likelihood of both pilots being incapacitated is very unlikely. 

BIG THANK YOU TO TFC KÄUFER for making this video possible 
such as Lockheed Martin Prepar3D flight simulator, here a few more facts about the used simulation:

I hope you enjoyed this video and where able to learn something from it as well. 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

What links a mysterious golden pot discovered in a Bavarian lake, a castle designed like a particle accelerator, Hitler’s Quest for the Sword of Destiny, and a fatally doomed hunt for the Holy Grail? This is the true story of The Nazi’s Temple of Doom.

Although disappointed by the discovery that a Celtic Cauldron was in fact manufactured in the 20th Century, it soon became apparent that this mysterious item could tell us more about the intricacies of Nazi plans for Germany than has ever been explored before. 

The Nazi Temple Of Doom follows the journey of how one item, found in Chiemsee Lake in Germany, revealed dark secrets about a group that were already known for their interest in Ancient Mythology and the Occult: the Nazis. Using the Nazi-made Celtic cauldron as a starting point, experts piece together the fascinating depths to which the Nazi ideology reached and explore their goals and expectations. It was long the objective of Heinrich Himmler, one of the highest members of the Third Reich and Head of the SS, to create a racially pure society in which a glorious German history was celebrated. In 1934, Himmler chose Wewelsburg Castle and its dark past as the SS base, and the beginnings of a Nazi cult, based on pre-Christian Germany, as he believed Christianity had no place in the ideology ofthe SS. 

This documentary special tells the tale of how Himmler drafted in experts to research and re-write a mythological, glorious German history and to build a Nazi-Vatican. The cauldron played an integral part in furthering Himmler’s cult and proving what he believed were Germany’s true Celtic origins. 

Using library footage, interviews and a gripping storyline, The Nazi Temple Of Doom reveals previously unexplored territory in the Nazi regime.

Summary:  I collected data at the carnival for a full day.  Then I used that information to figure out which games are the biggest scams using science to analyze them and show you how to beat them.  I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.

YouTube comments are at present disabled in our channel, to the displeasure of some. However, each video has a prominent link to the associated open thread that appears on our blog. In the past we've tried opening up the channel to comments, but we found that a very high number of episodes wound up being flooded with a combination of spam, long winded apologists, and various obscene or misogynistic comments directed at various hosts by people with an axe to grind. This seems to be the nature of YouTube comment sections, in our experience.

We do moderate the blog, the same way that we moderate chat during the show, as well as comments on our Facebook group. For comment sections that are ""officially"" associated with our show (and, to a much lesser extent, channels that may give the unintended appearance of being official), we prefer not to play host to straight up ad hominem attacks and bigotry. As a general policy we do not block commenters simply on the basis of disagreement with our point of view. However, we do prefer discussion environments that don't actively chase off more reasonable contributors.

How to blow 100 MILLION dollars as a creationist?

Honestly, this makes solar roadways look like a thoughtful and well planned use of money!

looks like the Ark Encounter will get significantly less than its projected minimum.  It had a lower bound of 1.5mn, and it looks like they will be lucky to break the million mark.  Further, if the slowly declining attendance of AiGs 'Creationist Museum' is anything to go by, they build the Ark Encounter at EXACTLY the wrong time!

YouTube comments are at present disabled in our channel, to the displeasure of some. However, each video has a prominent link to the associated open thread that appears on our blog. In the past we've tried opening up the channel to comments, but we found that a very high number of episodes wound up being flooded with a combination of spam, long winded apologists, and various obscene or misogynistic comments directed at various hosts by people with an axe to grind. This seems to be the nature of YouTube comment sections, in our experience.

We do moderate the blog, the same way that we moderate chat during the show, as well as comments on our Facebook group. For comment sections that are ""officially"" associated with our show (and, to a much lesser extent, channels that may give the unintended appearance of being official), we prefer not to play host to straight up ad hominem attacks and bigotry. As a general policy we do not block commenters simply on the basis of disagreement with our point of view. However, we do prefer discussion environments that don't actively chase off more reasonable contributors.

WHAT IS THE ATHEIST EXPERIENCE?

The Atheist Experience is a weekly call-in television show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist audience. The Atheist Experience is produced by the Atheist Community of Austin.

The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.

We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.

chemtrails,"What /Actually/ Happened at Chernobyl by vlogbrothers 1 week ago 13 minutes 583,983 views","This video was so dang fun to research, which, of course, I feel super guilty about because, like, real people died. But, after watching the HBO miniseries, I knew there was more to the science of this. I've also heard a lot of stuff from both credible and non-credible sources that just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The idea of the ""graphite tipped rods"" for example is just a simplification for broad audiences. But I've also heard smart folks talk about how RBMK reactors have a positive /fuel/ temperature coefficient, which is not true. No nuclear reactors do, since fuel that reacted more as it got hot would be the kind of thing that would explode every time. 

However, for a moment, because water had become such a vital part of the neutron absorption in the reactor, it did have a positive temperature coefficient...meaning that getting hotter made it hotter which made it hotter which made it hotter. That's a coefficient for the entire reactor, and it's due to the ""positive void coefficient"" where, as the water got hotter, it got less good at absorbing neutrons. 

Usually that would be more than counter-acted by the negative fuel temperature coefficient, which is why they thought it couldn't explode...but it was not in this particular circumstance.

Check out Audible: http://bit.ly/AudibleVe
I'm filming a documentary for TV about how Uranium and radioactivity have shaped the modern world. It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.

Notes about measuring radiation:
Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.

Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.
https://xkcd.com/radiation/

DOSES MAY VARY
The level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).

Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.

The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video. References are here:

Get a signed shade ball by supporting Veritasium: https://ve42.co/patreon

Receiving a shade ball:
1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon
2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls
3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers

My sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.

Sometimes she is even a man – the curmudgeonly Chris. In total, Marcela shares her body with seven different personalities. It’s called dissociative identity disorder and it’s one of the ways the brain copes with severe trauma.

chemtrails,"Debunking Chemtrails – Introduction – #1 by Myles Power 1 year ago 17 minutes 95,997 views","People online can unknowing find themselves in an echo-chamber, having their more fringe beliefs amplified and reinforced by a lack of exposure to conflicting views and evidence. That, coupled with the fact that anyone can publish anything online, has lead to a renaissance in conspiracy theories, pseudo-medical procedures, and general bad science. One of the more interesting conspiracy theories that seems to have grown in popularity over the last decade is the belief that the long-lasting white clouds left in the sky by aircraft are actually chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed on the population for nefarious reasons. The people who believe in this conspiracy theory call these lines in the sky 'chemtrails' and feel so strongly against them that they recently organised protests around the world. I decided to make a series of videos investigating the weird and wonderful world of chemtrails to hopefully shed some light on a conspiracy which most find hard to grasp.

Today we look at YouTuber goforitRandy who has not only had a dig at Buzz Aldrin, but also has some issues with the Lunar Module.  Let's see if his claims hold up in the face of pure Science!!!

Here is goforitRandy's original video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUepfJhxoOk&index=21&list=WL&t=0s

Thank you all for watching, and I'll see you Friday!


Here is the more detailed description regarding the Lunar Modules engines:

The maximum thrust of the descent propulsion system of the lunar module was 10’125 pounds. (We’re going to use pounds for simplicity). However it was not used above 60% of its maximum. So let’s say the absolute most thrust used was approximately 6000 pounds although during the descent it would not have been this much.

The diameter of the exhaust nozzle was 59 inches which means an area of 2732 inches squared.  Pressure is Force divided by area. So the total pressure exerted here is approximately 2.2 psi. 

I weigh around 190 pounds and my foot has an approximate area of 45 square inches. This means I exert a pressure of approximately 4.4 psi every time I take a step. 

So, you have an engine that exerts less pressure than a humans foot, firing against solid rock. It’s not really a surprise that there was no crater.",The Moon Landings Absolutely Happened!!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alqp2wHY_10,2,#NAME?,-1,820,246148,9830,1015,0,10982,267975

chemtrails,"Shale cowboys: fracking under Trump - Docu - 2017 by vpro documentary 1 year ago 47 minutes 652,548 views","Having your own energy sources is an important weapon in the world economy. Since 2013, the United States has made important foes of fossil-rich opponents like Saudi Arabia important in extracting shale gas and shale oil from its own soil. The price for a barrel of crude oil fell from 100 to less than $50. The Texan shale producers who survived this price tag are the new heroes of the United States. Under president Donald Trump, the shale cowboys are striving to help Europe to become independent. On research in Trumpland.

Original title: Schaliecowboys
Schale stone was considered worthless by the oil and gas industry in the past. They passed through on their way to expensive oil and gas that lay deeper. Until a small Texan gas company found a way in the late 1990's to win gas from hard-shelled rock. By making deep boreholes in the stone layers of the soil and injecting a large amount of water and chemicals under high pressure, shale gas and shale oil are won. With this method, later known as fracking, the energy market changed forever.

In the meantime, one third of gas and oil production in the United States is a shale.And the bid consumer of energy is not only content to be independent, the country is now even an exporter of energy. OPEC, the organization of (other) oil exporting countries, keeps the oil price on the world market as low as possible, to make American production worthless. But for the moment, the oil countries do not get the shale cowboys on their knees.

How does this controversial innovation put the world of energy upside down? Because this new offer of cheap energy really gives us more time to bridge the transition to a sustainable world of solar and wind energy. A few years ago, all experts and analysts went out of the Peak Oil Theory. Namely, the fossil reserves in the world were running out. The shale revolution turned this theory into old dirt in just a few years. Fracking technology opens a whole new reservoir of fossil fuels. 

The election of President Trump was greeted in Texas with joy and also seen as a recognition for what the shale revolution is going to be. And the future is even more rosy: recent geological research showed that hundreds of billions of dollars of shale oil are still in the so-called Wolf Camp Shale Field in West Texas. Who are the people behind this shale revolution? A portrait of the pioneers and the new Shale millionaires in Texas.

Daniel Yergin (energy specialist and author of The Prize and The Quest), Dan Steward, Kent Bowker and Nick Steinsberger (Shale Gas Revolution Geologists and Pioneers), Matt Miller (Dallas Gray Gray Energy Partners), Doug Shanda (Head of Operations Cheniere Energy in Port Arthur), Tommy Taylor (Director of Fasken Oil & Ranch from Midland Texas).

Upon regaining consciousness, Padgett’s sight was forever altered by a condition called acquired savant syndrome. The brain trauma opened his eyes to an entirely new world—one filled with patterns and strobes, like a stop-motion film. This is a fascinating story into the hidden power of the mind and one man’s inspiring tale of courage and personal triumph. The Acquired Savant is a film by Thomas Petersen.

This Great Big Film was made in collaboration with our friends at CNN Films. It is one of 12 short films that we will be releasing throughout the year. Stay tuned for more!

As we drag our bins out for collection each week, we feel like we’re helping the environment. But the reality is that we’re all being conned. Right now, Australia is stuck in an unsightly and worsening recycling crisis. What is being done with plastic waste, the material most people think would be easy to salvage and re-use, is of the greatest concern. As Liam Bartlett discovers, most of it ends up either being buried or worse – exported to countries like Malaysia, a place we are now treating like a garbage bin.

chemtrails,"Einstein's Nightmare | The Secrets Of Quantum Physics | Absolute Science by Absolute Science 2 months ago 58 minutes 154,882 views","Professor Jim Al-Khalili traces the story of arguably the most important, accurate and yet perplexing scientific theory ever: quantum physics.

The story of quantum physics starts at the beginning of the 20th century with scientists trying to better understand how light bulbs work. This simple question soon led scientists deep into the hidden workings of matter, into the sub-atomic building blocks of the world around us.  Here they discovered phenomena unlike any encountered before - a realm where things can be in many places at once, where chance and probability call the shots and where reality appears to only truly exist when we observe it.

Albert Einstein hated the idea that nature, at its most fundamental level, is governed by chance. Jim reveals how in the 1930's, Einstein thought he'd found a fatal flaw in quantum physics. This was not taken seriously until it was tested in the 1960s. Professor Al-Khalili repeats this critical experiment, posing the question does reality really exist, or do we conjure it into existence by the act of observation?

Elsewhere, we explore how the most famous law of quantum physics – The Uncertainty Principle – is obeyed by plants and trees as they capture sunlight during the vital process of photosynthesis. Could quantum mechanics explain the greatest mystery in biology - evolution?

This video is sponsored by 23andMe https://23andme.com/veritasium
Huge thanks to Prof. Immo Hansen and team: http://ve42.co/hansen

Genome Wide Association Study for self-reported mosquito attractiveness:
http://ve42.co/MossieGWAS

The twin study showing correlated attractiveness is stronger for identical twins:
http://ve42.co/MossieTwins

Some things we know make mosquitoes more attracted to you:
Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

chemtrails,"Agafia. Hermit Surviving in Russian Wilderness for 70 years by RT Documentary 4 years ago 52 minutes 4,624,873 views","More films about religion: https://rtd.rt.com/tags/religion/
Soon after this film aired, Agafia found a helper who has now been living with her for more than a year. Georgy Danilov, 53, is from Orenburg. He is an Old Believer. It was Agafia’s spiritual father who found and blessed her helper. Georgy has been doing the toughest chores for almost two years: he chops firewood, brings water from the river, and digs the vegetable garden. Agafia doesn’t always see eye to eye with Georgy. She views him as a novice and demands his full obedience and submission, which doesn’t always sit well with Georgy. Despite their differences, they try to find common ground. Apart from the main helper, volunteers and students from various Russian cities also come to Agafia’s hut to help her out.

In the mid-17th century, the leader of Russia’s Orthodox Church, Patriarch Nikon, introduced radical reforms in Russia. Many couldn’t accept the changes and became known as “Old Believers”. To avoid religious persecution first from the Orthodox Church and then from the Soviets, families fled to some of the most remote corners of the world. In 1978, one such family was discovered by a group of geologists in the remote Russian Republic of Khakassia, Siberia. The Lykovs looked as if they belonged to a previous century: they dressed in homespun clothes and used primitive instruments in their everyday life. They were completely self-sufficient and still highly religious. 

Today, Agafia, 70, is the last surviving member of this family.  When RT Doc filmmakers met her, she was in desperate need of a helper. They encourage her to write a letter to Old Believers everywhere in an attempt to find one. This letter, written in Old Slavonic language, is available on our site.

The film crew also interviews Erofey Sedov, a former drilling geologist. He was one of those who discovered the Lykovs and told the world about them. He got to know them well and is now ready to share information that will make us see the familiar story of this family of hermits in a different light. But is any of it true?

Achille and Giovanni Judica-Cordiglia were two highly regarded radio engineers from Italy who, starting with the launch of Sputnik, made a name for themselves by tracking and recording radio signals from satellites in orbit.

Over time, they bought an old WWII bunker and transformed it into a listening station they named Torre Bert.

From here, the recorded everything from the heartbeat of Laika, the dog on Sputnik 2, to Yuri Gagarin.

But they also recorded some mysterious sounds from missions that were never made public by the highly secretive Soviet Union. One of these was of a woman crying out in distress in May of 1961.

If real, this would have been the first female in space, a full 2 years before the current first, Valentina Tereshkova.

To this day, Russian officials have never named or acknowledged the existence of a mission that this could have been from. Was this a doomed cosmonaut in her final moments? Or a clever hoax?

chemtrails,"An Audience with Neil Armstrong (2011 interview) by Slartibartfast 7 months ago 49 minutes 280,082 views","In this interview, the first man to walk on the moon gives a personal commentary on Apollo 11’s historic lunar landing along with his thoughts on leadership and taking risks to innovate for the future.

Neil Armstrong is a household name, yet, in contrast to his crew-mate Buzz Aldrin, he has studiously stayed out of the spotlight in the decades since he walked on the Moon. He frequently passed on interview and advertising requests, all the while beating back unwelcome advances on his legacy.

So it was a coup of sorts for Certified Practicing Accountants organization of Australia to score an extended interview with Armstrong, a connection that seems about as natural as a two-headed kangaroo. (CEO Alex Malley had developed the relationship, sharing his concerns about long-term strategic planning both in business and politics with Armstrong. The interview was a part of CPA Australia’s 125th anniversary celebration.)

Armstrong shows flashes of the rationality and equanimity that made him an ideal astronaut candidate in the first place. He confesses that he gave Apollo 11 a 90% chance of returning home safely, but just a 50% chance of landing on the Moon successfully. He expresses a sense of fate about his dangerous work as a test pilot and astronaut, refusing to worry about future tasks because he figured something would go wrong first and he’d be otherwise engaged firing the ejection seat or scrambling to repair a valve. Of his time on the Moon’s surface: “we weren’t there to meditate, we were there to get things done.”",An Audience with Neil Armstrong (2011 interview),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJzOIh2eHqQ,3,0/moonlanding,0,2994,309283,4052,281,0,3755,317371

In this interview he talks about near-death-experiences (NDE), death-bed-visitors and how we can achieve a good death.

NDE research is at the cutting edge of consciousness research and offers a convincing model for the understanding of what happens when we die. Peter Fenwick describes the different transitional phases of the dying process and highlights the importance of letting go at the end of ones life.

He offers fascinating insights into common phenomena at the end of life, such as premonitions, seeing a light, death-bed-visions and coincidences. 

In his opinion everybody should know about death and the dying process, because it is a normal part of living.

Dear friends and followers! 
Have you ever asked yourself how often does an airliner refuel? Do airliners only carry so much fuel the need for one flight or more flights. You immediately think about your maximum weight of your hand luggage you are allowed to bring on your flight. So why would a plane carry tons of unnecessary fuel around?  That will be the topic of today. 
I´ll be explaining you the fuel profit tankering procedure which is a common procedure on shorter flights where the maximum take-off and landing weight aren´t an issue. So I´ll be going through the fuel tankering procedure step by step. I´ll be mentioning the taxi fuel, trip fuel, contingency fuel, alternate fuel and final reserve and which of these figures are more important and less during your fuel planning. And at the end of the video, I´ll be explaining you why the fuel profit tankering is not the most economically friendly procedure, but on how airlines become more profitable and use this technic to save fuel. 

I hope you enjoy this tutorial one fuel tankering and hopefully you can use this procedure in your upcoming flights.

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel, today´s question is: What is the meaning behind the numbers and letters on the runway? 
I´m sure many of you have seen my approach and landing videos here on youtube, and you might have wondered, what is that number and letter you see on the runway just prior touchdown. 
Let´s first talk about the number. 
 
We´re gonna have to cover some basic navigation first. 
As we look at our planet earth we have the geometric north and south pole in each hemisphere, marking the top and bottom of the planet. But there´s no instrument besides GPS which could guide us towards these poles. 
But the planet has it´s own magnetic field surrounding the earth, creating the magnetic north and south pole which are slightly off of the geometric poles.

Now you´ve all seen a compass, and you know that the needle always points towards magnetic north. 
Now let´s look at this runway here, you can see the numbers 08, 
let´s imagine you would draw a line all the way from the magnetic north pole down until it crosses the runway centerline. You would see that the two lines create an opening angle of 080 degrees. Meaning the runway centerline is 080 degrees relative to the magnetic north pole.

So why is there only a 08 on the runway? There are two reasons for that. 
Let´s say the magnetic heading of the runway would be 084. Then it would be rounded off to the nearest tenth, so in this case, 080, leaving out the last zero, you have runway ""Zero eight"".  But if you would name the runway ""zero eight zero"" could lead to misinterpretation as given headings are spelled the same way, like fly heading 120 for example. 
Now as you sit in your plan on the runway, in this example runway 05 in Madeira you know you know your plane nose is pointing 050 degrees, so heading northeast, and your airplane tail is pointing + 180 degrees into the opposite direction, so the reciprocal runway should be? Yes, runway ""two tree"".

But more about that in the video :) 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

Dear friends and followers, welcome back and to the first proper interview on my channel. 
I´ve have used ""Kennedy Steve´s"" voice in countless intro or to explain a ATC related question until I reached out to Steve via one of my videos. A day later he wrote me an e-mail and we planned out to meet for an interview at JFK airport. So I took the next flight to JFK and met with Steve and flew back a couple of hours later. 
You were so kind to send in the question you would like me to ask Steve about his life and career as an airtraffic controller. 

Here are your most asked questions for Steve: 

01:06 - Where die you start your career as an airtraffic controller? 
01:23 - Which positions did you work on? 
01:56 - How long were your shifts? 
02:29 - Which was your favorite position? 
02:52 - What´s your opinion on the JFK layout? 
03:45 - Describe your work with Concorde? 
05:14 - Have you dealt with emergencies at JFK? 
07:12 - The Lufthansa pilot who got out of the plane? 
08:21 - Do you have a favorite airline? 
08:50 - Do you have a favourite airplane? 
09:39 - Were you on duty during 9/11? 
10:19 - Do you have a pilot license? 
10:36 - Can you tell an ATC jokes? 
11:22 - Do you have favorite aviation movie? 
12:00 - Did you ever get in trouble with your supervisor? 
12:45 - Why did you change your voice whilst talking to the tugs?
13:53 - Have you ever spoken to AirForceOne? 

I really hope you enjoyed this first interview of mine with such a great personality like Kennedy Steve?! I have one more interview to fly too, and I can wait to get started on that one :) 

Thank you very much for your time, wishing you all the best, see you next week!

When mercury is added to aluminum, it forms an amalgam (a mercury alloy). 

Aluminum is normally protected by a thick oxide layer, but the formation of the amalgam disrupts it. It allows fresh aluminum to react with air to form white aluminum oxide. As the oxide grows, it forms as these cool white fibers.

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel! In today´s video will be talking about the water and waste system of airplanes. Or you might say, how do airplanes deal with your sh...?! 

The system consists of the following components:
- toilets
- meters of piping 
- 170-liter waste tank
- couple valves 
- vacuum generator
- drain host 
- servicing panels.
 
So let´s imagine we´re in cruise, you´ve been to the toilet and you press the flush button. An electrical signal is sent to a flush control unit and checks the airplane´s current altitude via a pressure switch. 
The control unit opens up the water valve to rinse the toilet and a second later you can hear the flush valve opening up and sucking out your disposal.
But the question is how?
The waste system, pipes, and waste tank are constantly subject to suction pressure, as there is a pipe leading to the outer skin of the airplane. So as soon as the flush valve opens up, at the bottom of the toilet bowl, the differential pressure between the cabin pressure and the outer atmospheric pressure, sucks and pushes the waste through the pipes to the waste tank. That´s one of the reasons why the toilet door has no door seals and vent grid, otherwise, the suction would be strong enough to suck out the air within that small toilet. So to get rid of a smelly odor, you might as well press the flush button a couple of times. And to clarify one on-going rumor, No your waste do NOT go overboard.

But see more as I´ll also explain the potable water system and how both systems are drained on ground. 

Thanks for watching, all the best your ""Captain"" Joe

Dear friends and followers welcome back to my channel and to a great video about the BODY GEAR STEERING of the Boeing 747. 

So as we look at the 747-400 you can see that she is one very long airplane, 70,7 meters in length and 64.9 meters of wingspan, not to mention her younger and even longer sister the 747-8, but I´ll come back to her in a minute. 
A problem the 747 is facing from time to time, at given airports, is not just the length and wingspan but her turning radius and width needed to perform a 180-degree turn. 

The landing gear of the 747 consists of four main landing gear assemblies, the wing gear, which is mounted in the wing root on either side and the body gear mounted in the belly/fuselage. 
If we look closely at the body gear you can see those two actuators, those are the body gear steering actuators which can rotate the entire truck by 13 degrees to either side.
Now the body gear is electrically linked to the nosewheel steering, meaning if either pilot moves the nosewheel tiller, to steer the plane along a taxiway, as soon as the nosewheel is deflected more than 20 degrees, let´s say to the left, the body gear steering comes active and each body gear truck rotates in the opposite direction, as the respective actuator, in this case, the right one, forces the forward part of the truck to the right and aft to the left. And obviously into the other direction placing the tiller to the right. 

Interesting to know, the system hydraulically centres the body gear and deactivates the system if the ground speed increases beyond 20 knots, and comes active again when the speed decrease through 15 knots. Besides that, the rudder pedals which are also connected to the nosewheel steering, won´t activate the body gear steering at any time, as you can only deflect the nose wheel by 7 degrees to either side not reaching the activation of 20 degrees like the tiller.

But so more within the video!

Thank you very much for your time! I hope you enjoy this video!
Wishing you all the best!

chemtrails,"Chemtrail Pilot by fishersofmenvideo 3 years ago 6 minutes, 45 seconds 794 views","This is my adaptation of the Animals 60s classic ""Sky Pilot""
Only, rather than the story of a minister of Christ caught up in the
horror of the Vietnam war, this new version is the story of an airline
pilot who finds himself embroiled in the hidden-in-plane-sight horror of global ""stratospheric aerosols geoengineering""...aka
""SAG"", ""SRM"" (solar remediation management) or, in the vernacular, ""chemtrails"".

This program creates those long white trails behind jet aircraft.
These trails persist, spread, interlock, and eventually form artificial clouds and uniform, smeary overcasts, blocking sunlight. These are not ""vapour trails"", as is the usual sheeple explanation.

 This is a weather control/weaponization program that has been ongoing for at least 20 years, with zero public acknowledgement from any government on Earth.
 It is high time it was dealt with in the open, before this planet is irreversibly polluted by the various toxic nano-metallic
particles being sprayed by the megaton, right over our heads.
We need more courageous pilots, like Willem Felderhof, formerly with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, to come forward and really blow the lid off of this issue.

A great site, with a motherlode of information is:
www.geoengineeringwatch.org
www.globalskywatch.com is also very good.

I hope you will find this song interesting, and also that it might lead you to find out more about ""SAG"", and it's ongoing effects upon our home planet. And, if you are up for a more Biblical/spiritual take on the whole mess, check out ""Boil The Frog"", also on this channel.

Here are the lyrics for ""Chemtrail Pilot"":

When he was a young boy, he'd look to the sky
Watched as the airplanes soared on high
Dreamed that one day, he might learn how to fly
Spread wings like an angel, and take to the sky

Then as a young man he followed his dream
Took flying lessons in blue skies so clean
Got him a job with the airline machine
Climbed up the corporate ladder to a co-pilot's seat

Hey, young pilot  
How high will you fly?
Did you ever think that you'd destroy the sky?

As years rolled by, he flew the world
Found a wonderful wife, had a sweet baby girl
Earned the bars on his shoulders to match his captain's chair
Flew the biggest airliners from here to there

Then, little by little, everything changed
What he saw from his cockpit struck him as strange
Long white lines cross the sky, more than ever before
But these were no vapour trails, so what was the score?

Chemtrail pilots  How blind can you fly?
Can't you see what you're doing to our Earth and Sky?

Crossing the sea at cruise altitude
He had a near head-on collision with a bogey so rude
No transponder, no warning, no who what or why,
Just a big unmarked jet leaving a huge trail across the sky

Chemtrail pilots, how blind can you fly?
Can't you see what you're doing to our Earth and sky?

Then one day, his plane had a new thing
Some cute little nozzles under the wing
He asked, ""Hey, what's this?""
His boss said, ""You don't want to know...
just fly the plane and get on with the show""

Chemtrail pilots, how blind can you fly?
Can't you see what you're doing to our Mother Earth and sky?

It's been 20 years now, they've laid their lines
Still, few even look up, or dare to ask why
The world's getting darker and sicker all the time
And all of the pilots fly the scene of the crime

Chemtrail pilots, how blind can you fly?
Don't you see what you're doing 
To our Mother Earth and sky?

When will you wake up, when will you know
That evil on high leads to death here below?
If you chemtrail pilots just stood up and said, ""NO!""
You might lose your job, but you'd save your soul

Chemtrail pilots
Now is the time, save the Earth
Expose the Sky Crime
Now is the time, save your families
Expose the Sky Crime
Now is the time, save humanity
Expose the Sky Crime!

Chemtrail pilots, how blind can you fly?
Don't you know what you're doing
To our Mother Earth and Sky???",Chemtrail Pilot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arMJE6VA18s,1,,1,405,795,10,2,0,4,811

From one of the pages:
The Federal Government has been supporting and conducting
weather modification research for more than 30 years.
In 1946, American scientists first modified clouds by ""seeding""
them with dry ice. In the ensuing years, the level
of effort for weather modification has grown sporadically
among, between, and within various Federal agencies. In
fiscal year 1978, $18 million was spent on Federal weather
modification research projects. Periodic drought conditions
in the United States and the resulting water shortage have
heightened congressional, regional, and local interest in
weather modification--specifically precipitation enhancement.

GEOENGINEERING EXPOSED !!! Investigation Demanded by Shasta County Residents On July 15th, 2014 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4WhYKP83zo

This is from the description of Tanker Enemy's Channel: He was one of the first people to download it and re-post it.

A pilot shots a chemical plane from his cockpit: the video shows an aircraft that spread chemtrails over Canada from the nozzles. The footage is the irrefutable proof of a chemical and clandestine operation that a bold pilot offers to the public in order to demonstrate that chemtrails are real. The ""smoke"" we can see is neither a fuel dumping nor a contrail. The chemtrails, in fact, is iridescent too. Don't listen to hoaxers who repeat that this document is false or similar lies. The author of this important video writes to Tanker Enemy:

""Nice job tanker enemy... I like the enhancements. Btw, I took the video while we were flying over Canada. Thanks for translating the video so more people will understand what's going on. I'll post more as I see them"".

USAFFEKC1O's account has just been closed. This thing confirms that another individual had preyed it, stealing his access' data (another military or one of the stalkers) and writing all that nonsense in every copied video around the internet:this actions come clearly from the YouTube Staff. I've never seen such things before,really! The gravity and truthfulness of the footage is strengthened. Let's spread it everywhere!

Dear friends and followers, today I´ll explain the ever so mysterious topic about chemtrails. Do they exist, or is it all just a huge rumour? 
I will present 4 different examples of possible chemtrails, with facts if they are true or false. We´ll look at wing tip vortices, wake turbulences, famous contrails in comparison to chemtrails. Black smoke coming out of engines on departures and go-around procedures. 
The rumour about chemtrails are spreading with every new idea some came up with, apparently chemtrails are used to manage solar radiation, psychological manipulation, human population control, weather modification or chemical warfare, at least that´s what I found out about it on the internet.  
To make matters worse, it causes illnesses and other health problems. And you´re saying it´s all coming out of the back of my plane? Hmm seems very superstitious if you ask me? We never had to sign a document during cockpit preparation stating, “20 tonnes of chemicals have been loaded and are ready for disposal”. 
But still, they must be somewhere? 
Okay, let´s see if we can find these chemtrails. 

Enjoy the video and share if you feel the same way about chemtrails! 

All the best and see you next thursday, your ""Captain"" Joe

You’ve probably noticed these white streaks in the sky. They’re clouds of water vapor that form when the warm exhaust of a plane’s engine encounters cold temperatures in the upper atmosphere. But some people think there’s a lot more to the story. Conspiracy theorists call these chemtrails, and believe the government is spraying chemicals into the atmosphere in order to control the weather and population - a practice they call “geoengineering.”

chemtrails,"Dr Dietrich Klinghardt MD PhD - Geo-engineering, Chemtrails, Aluminium, Round-up, Detox, Lyme by Electromagnetic Refugee 2 years ago 9 minutes, 49 seconds 27,941 views","This is a 9 minute edit I've made of a 2hr 45min presentation by Neurobiologist Dr Dietrich Klinghardt MD PhD. He discusses the intrinsic link between our health and that of our environment, the huge levels of nanonised aluminium he's finding in his patients (which he states is clearly due to aerial spraying for geo-engineering purposes) and the synergistic toxicity role between aluminium and Round-up (glyphosate). He states that toxicity leads to the loss of control of parasites in our body such as Lyme and provides valuable insights into foods and natural supplements effective in detoxing, aiding to regain and maintain good health. I've repeatedly heard and read him state that he believes, from his 40 years of experience, that man-made electromagnetic radiation, organophosphates and geo-engineering fallout are currently the biggest threats to and having the largest impact on human health. 

*NB; A note of caution if attempting to detox such materials; Mobilising more toxins in your body than it can effectively and safely eliminate could cause significant increase in ill health and be potentially life threatening. Before attempting to do so, I strongly recommend you watch the full source video  (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ACOan6pO6gg  in which he discusses specific binders to absorb and safely eliminate mobilised toxins), do further research and ideally seek personal professional guidance.

http://www.klinghardtacademy.com/biodata/dr-dietrich-klinghardt.html

*Personal side notes; What motivated Monsanto, I wonder, to produce aluminium resistant crops (which are also resistant to Round-up with which they are designed to be routinely sprayed). Is it a conincidence I wonder, that as described by Klinghardt here, Round-up acts as a chelator for the trace minerals in the crops, binding to them and preventing their proper absorbtion from the food into the body, whilst binding aluminium and efficiently transporting it deep into the brain and central nervous system :/

It's also worth noting that Bayer are in the process of taking over Monsanto, the former playing a large role not only in the creation and function of the European Union, but also had an intimate involvement in aiding the Nazi's;

'Official documents from the U.S. Congress and the Nuremberg war crimes tribunals unequivocally show that WWII was not only prepared, but also logistically and technically facilitated by the largest and most notorious oil and drug cartel at that time, namely, the German IG Farben cartel, composed of Bayer, BASF, Hoechst and other chemical companies. The summary of the indictment from Nuremberg proves that without IG Farben, WWII could not have taken place.'

Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Ephesians 5:11-16 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

chemtrails,"Chemtrails Exposed! by MotorMac 1 month ago 1 minute, 56 seconds 35 views","Of all conspiracy theories, this one is up there - no pun intended - with flat earth and the tooth fairy. To believe that jets are spraying chemicals all the way across the sky from 30,000 feet is to ignore physics, nature, science and reality. Without straying off course here, we’ll keep it simple with three easy observations:
1 - An aircraft cannot carry enough material to create such a plume, even if entire fuselage were to be packed with chemicals.
2 - Spraying anything at 30,000 feet guarantees dispersement anywhere except on target - if it ever reaches the ground at all.
3 - No proof exists, no evidence of manufacture, transport or loading of such chemicals, no sample, no clear purpose or effect.

This short clip clearly demonstrates how and why vapor trails form at high elevations. Lower planes have no trails, trails can be seen to start and stop as planes pass thru weather patterns and moisture condenses on windows. These are not jet aircraft, they are B-17s delivering bombs in WWII with no room or reason to be spreading chemicals. This historic clip unintentionally destroys all the popular chemtrail crap in less than two minutes.

Adherents to this myth refuse to get over the childish fear of natural phenomena in favor of blaming countless ills on a foolish theory - to their own detriment. They bemoan their helplessness, express anger at being victimized in such a way, blame it for virtually everything that goes wrong, then grudgingly go about their daily life under a make-believe cloud (so to speak).

Promoters of the chemtrail myth have used photos of aircraft fitted with tanks in place of seats as “proof.” These pictures are easily debunked by tracing origin to Boeing’s early development of the 727 in which water tanks were used to simulate load shifting around the cabin. What this actually proves is the dishonest nature of said promoters looking for donations to fund their “research” from those paralyzed by the fear they spread.

Learning how vapor trails are formed and why they only occur at high elevations should dispel this myth. But, as Mark Twain famously said, “it’s easier to fool people than to convince them they’ve been fooled,” so don’t expect this myth to dissipate any time soon.

The Chemtrail/Geo-Engineering Coverup Revealed ====☁☢☁====☁☢☁====✈
Trails of white, emitted behind jet aircraft, stretching from horizon to horizon, turn our skys into a blanket of overcast that blocks out our sunshine. Our innate intelligence tells us these are not mere vapor trails from jet engines.

Who is doing this and why? Here is the story of a rapidly developing industry called geo-engineering, driven by scientists, corporations, and governments, intent on changing global climate, controlling the weather, and altering the chemical composition of soil and water.

Although government officials insist that these programs are only in the discussion phase, evidence is abundant that they have been underway since about 1990 -- The effect has been devastating to crops, wildlife, and humans. We are being sprayed with toxic substances, without our consent. To add insult to injury, they lie to us about it and try to coverup the Chemtrail/Geo-Engineering that is ongoing.

According to all government organizations, chemtrails do not exist and/or are a conspiracy theory. They claim that the white lines in the sky stretching from horizon to horizon are normal jet contrails.

Somehow, I assume using theoretical physics, these contrails can first appear as small white lines high in the sky then, over the course of hours, expand as they float down to earth first creating small clouds and finally a haze. This is exactly what is happening.
They were spraying us something fierce today above San Francisco. They often do it before a weather front is coming in. There were lines in every direction, a big X in the sky and then the inevitable haziness.

Everybody saw it. Many people knew what it was. Many do not want to realize it, so they may never. If you want to be a good slave, I'm sure you will bend over and take the easy way out.
I do not appeal to the slave rather I appeal to the person who has the courage to stand up for humanity and accept themselves as the only authority. I suggest that you read the following exposé and ask the tough questions about what OUR government says is NOT happening.

Chemtrail conspiracy theory

The chemtrail conspiracy theory is the false claim that long-lasting condensation trails, called ""chemtrails"" by proponents, consist of chemical or biological agents left in the sky by high-flying aircraft and deliberately sprayed for purposes undisclosed to the general public. Believers in the theory argue that normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly and contrails that do not dissipate must contain additional substances.

NASA Confesses to Dosing Americans with Air-borne Lithium & Other Chemicals

Geoengineering is the intentional, large-scale technological manipulation of the Earth’s systems, often discussed as a techno-fix for combating climate change. Climate geoengineering technologies can be divided into three broad areas: so-called solar radiation management (reflecting sunlight to space), greenhouse gas removal and sequestration and weather modification.

CHEMTRAILS DESTROY YOUR IMMUNE FUNCTION
“I believe the chemtrails are responsible for a chemical intoxication of the public, which would then cause a general immune suppression, low grade to high grade, depending on exposure. The immune dysfunction allows people to become susceptible to opportunistic infections, such as this micoplasma and other opportunistic infections”, says Dr. Horowitz.

Notably, retired USDA Biologist, Frances Mangels has found the pH rises from 5.5 to 6.8 in association with aerosol geoengineering activity.

Hallo zusammen,


NSA – Whistleblower Snowden enthüllt schockierende Wahrheit hinter den Chemtrails   
ExtremNews

 
Edward Snowden, der NSA-Whistleblower, welcher Zugang zu jeder geheimen Ecke des Internets während seiner Anstel­lung bei der NSA hatte, soll laut einem Artikel des Bloggers ""Kilgoar"" auch Details über ein geheimes Projekt zur Manipulation das Weltklimas enthüllt haben. Die schockie­rende Wahrheit ist, wie er sagt, dass Chemtrails ein Teil eines „wohltätigen“ Programms sind, welches darauf abzielt, der globalen Erwärmung entgegen zu arbeiten.
 
In dem Artikel, der von dem Umweltaktivisten Werner Altnickel in deutsch übersetzt wurde, schreibt ""Kilgoar"": ""Durch geheime Koope­ration mit Flugzeugtreibstoffherstellern haben US Regierungsagen­ten die massiven Chemtrail– Anstrengungen sorgfältig komplett versteckt.

 
Snowden fügte hinzu:“ Ich enthülle nur deshalb dieses Programm, weil da keine Beaufsichtigung in der wissenschaftlichen Gemein­schaft besteht, keine öffentliche Diskussion stattfindet und nur wenig Beunruhigung oder Interesse für die Nebeneffekte vorhanden ist, welche nur einigen wenigen privilegierten Leuten gut bekannt sind, welche an der geheimen Weiterführung des Dekaden langen Chemtrail– Programms interessiert sind.


Denn der Klimawandel ist eine Bedrohung für die US-Landwirtschaft, es wurde zu einer nationalen Sicherheits– Angelegenheit erklärt. Mit dem Einfluss und der Kooperation von Monsanto operiert ein geheimes Geoengineering– Laboratorium mit dem Namen MUAD DIB, welches seit den späten 1960er Jahren betrieben wird und das Chemtrail– Programm wird oft von den Insidern als ihr „Kronjuwel“ verehrt.


 
MUAD DIB beabsichtigt Nordamerikas Klima um jeden Preis zu bewahren – sogar wenn dies bedeutet, dass es die Wüstenausbreitung in der unteren Afrikanischen Sahara beschleunigt oder die Ausbreitungs­spuren von Karzinogenen über gering bevölkerten Gebieten vergrößert.

 
Andere Nebeneffekte, welche die Wissenschaftler vom geheimen MUAD DIB Geoenginering Laboratorium vorhergesagt haben, beinhalten Trockenheiten am Amazonas und kraftvolle Stürme entlang der Ost– und Westküste der USA.


 
Snowden machte dem „Internet Chronicle“ Dokumente zugänglich, doch ohne Besorgnis für die natio­nale Sicherheit kann nur sein Zeugnis veröffentlicht werden.

 
 
Diese Dokumente beinhalten Verweise auf Wissenschaftler, die sicherlich zur Zielscheibe für fremde Gegenspionage würden und ihr Wissen ist vital für das kurzfristige Überleben der USA.

 
Snowden sagte: „Dass die Wissenschaftler hinter dem Programm fest daran glauben, dass wenn dieses Programm gestoppt würde, das Nordamerikanische Klima außer Kontrolle geriete und Ernteausfälle zu einer Serie von verheerenden Hungersnöten führen würden, welche schnell städtische Zentren entvöl­kern würden.“

 
Denn das Programm wurde bereits in solch einem massiven Maßstab durchgeführt, dass Skeptiker Snowdens Geschichte unglaublich finden könnten. Wie auch immer, Snowden erklärte, dass das Chem­trail Programm unglaublich leicht zu verheimlichen war, speziell durch die Kooperation mit Flugzeugtreibstoff-Herstellern welche ein entscheidender Teil des Militärisch– Industriellen Komplexes sind.

During a marathon session of tweeting with fans and followers Monday night, Kylie took a break to make us think.

The (poorly spelled) image she posted asks questions common amongst those familiar with the chemtrails movement, a group of people who believe either the government or the Illuminati (depending who you ask) is spreading chemicals used to brainwash the population using the contrails formed by airplanes.” *

In some ways this has been a very good thing. But it’s also given rise to a platform for any insane idea, and for anyone who is trying to make a buck. With all this information so easily accessible, it’s made many of us feel like we’re experts after a little Googling. It doesn’t matter if we have little real familiarity with a subject. This has helped give rise to an industry of hucksters who decry mainstream medicine, touting instead their alternative cures that they will happily supply to you — for the right price. Unfortunately, these con routines have caused a lot of people to distrust mainstream medicine. This distrust has spawned all manner of bizarre conspiracy theories.

An artistic view of the marks left on our skies by high-flying jet aircraft. Sometimes annoying, sometimes spectacular, their motion is often easier to appreciate when sped-up by the magic of time-lapse photography.

These scenes were selected from over 700 sequences, captured in the skies over Santa Clarita, California during the years 2006-2008.

The soundtrack is ""Stitching the Sky"" from the ""TimeShift"" CD by Technician (yours truly), album and single track available on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/timeshift/id810049912   full artist discography and CDs available at  HTTP://technician.jcmdi.com

Riva stereo FLV encoding parameters for video: 270kbps, 30fps; audio: 64kbps, 22khz stereo. 

The video is slightly degraded (more than the usual YouTube mono encoding) due to the added bandwidth taken by the stereo audio, but I think the music is worth it.

Enjoy!

About jet trails - fact and speculation
(You decide which is which!)
----------------------------------------
The exact composition and effects of jet trails (also called ""Contrails"", ""Chemtrails"", and ""Aviation Cirrus"") are somewhat controversial. Observation indicates that on days when the upper atmosphere is dry, jet trails can evaporate quickly (known as ""Contrails""). But when the atmosphere contains higher humidity levels, jet trails can remain in the sky for hours or days (known as ""Chemtrails""), as their particles (aerosols) provide man-made nuclei for combustion-produced, and pre-existing atmospheric water vapor to condense and freeze upon.

Natural atmospheric conditions/air movements can be extremely dynamic, causing these artificial clouds to expand, grow, and twist into many shapes which often become unrecognizable as jet trails over time. Mutant jet trails can resemble natural clouds or may cover the entire sky in a soupy haze. Trails may start and stop abruptly, be fat or thin, and evaporate quickly or not at all, with any combination thereof, as aircraft travel through atmospheric areas/layers which may be completely different within as little as 500 feet from each other.

Jet trails are known to contain a great deal of water vapor (H2O), with smaller amounts of CO2, CO, NO, NO2 (and other gases), unburned hydrocarbons/particulates (aerosols) of carbon and other material. Even more compounds may be created by combustion of aerosols and gases already present in the atmosphere.

Additionally, aerosols created by combustion of any fuel contaminates/additives in the fuel system are also likely to be present in jet trails. Chemicals such as Diethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (an anti-icing agent), barium t-octylphenol sulfide (an anti-oxidizing agent), barium-based biocides, fuel stabilizers and many other additives are possible. Aluminum oxide from microbe/moisture-related corrosion of aluminum aircraft fuel tanks may also be present (all of which are speculated here).

Commercial cloud seeding (silver iodide crystals, etc.) and government/scientific weather modification experiments are well documented, but such programs are likely to be small scale and not generally visible to the public on a daily basis as we are seeing in our skies today.

The intentional spraying of aerosols for geo-engineering, and toxins for subversive purposes have also been speculated, but the vast majority of world-wide trails we see are more likely the result of large-scale corporate money-making activity, i.e. the huge number of high-altitude commercial flights each day, rather than global black-ops programs intended to tweak the weather or intentionally harm the entire human race (which, incidentally, would also harm all the conspirators and their families).

In any case, jets trails are not harmless. These man-made clouds have been shown to alter and pollute our atmosphere in many ways. The exact chemical content and atmospheric physics of jet trails are still evolving sciences, and much is being learned. There is a great deal of fact and much speculation available online for us to study and contemplate. All who are interested are encouraged to further seek and study the problems and concerns associated with this man-made phenomenon...",Stitching The Sky -TimeLapse Contrails Chemtrails Clouds V00688,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqh_03-TFNU,0,,0,177,40334,266,19,0,367,40986

This message is (allegedly) from a USAF pilot, who flies aerosol tankers, as part of the secret Indigo Sky fold (geo-engineered aerosol ""chemtrail"") program.
Please forward the video!

If you have a geiger counter, with an alpha/beta probe, please test the aerosol fallout, now, and after January 20, 2015. The best way to test the aerosols is to wipe your car hood, and windshield, with a clean paper towel, after a dry period of heavy spraying. Then, test the towel for alpha and beta radiation. This is especially important in California, which has no natural radon sources upwind.

You can support further projects with a donation on: http://overcastthemovie.com

OVERCAST is a groundbreaking documentary about a phenomenon that most of us would consider normal: Jet contrails that spread into clouds, covering the sky and blocking the sun. For some people however, these trails are the biggest environmental crime in the history of mankind. Recent studies show that manmade cirrus clouds through flight traffic have a far bigger impact on climate change than previously assumed and are already described as unintentional Geoengineering. 

OVERCAST brings light into a phenomenon that should be part of the public and climate debate, but instead has been mostly ignored so far.

This is a message, from a credible source. This message is from a U S A F pilot. who (allegedly) flies Aerosol Tankers. as part of the secret Program called. Indigo Skyfold.  A geo engineered aerosol ""chemtrails"" program.

Please. 
may I call your special attention to the part of his testimony which implies: ""a very new ""extremely toxic"" chemtrail mix, is going to be sprayed. Using new technology, that makes these special chemtrails, completely invisible.""

If you have a geiger counter, with an alpha/beta probe, please test the aerosol fallout. now. and after January 20, 2015. The best way to test the aerosols, is to wipe your car hood and windshield. with a clean paper towel, after a dry period of heavy spraying. Then, test the towel for alpha and beta radiation. This is especially important in California. which has no natural radon sources upwind.

By the way. the building at 7:30. is the International Criminal Court. at The Hague Netherlands. This is where the criminals behind these programs need to be taken, to be put on trial, while the world watches.

Mars One. The Mars Rover. Bruno Mars. Mars Bars. It's pretty clear we're OBSESSED with the idea of Mars, especially in regard to it being a potential colony for earthlings. But is that really the best option? Is there a better place for us to colonize in our solar system? Well, how about Venus?  Sure the surface temperature is over 450 degrees Celsius, with crazy pressure, but there might be a smart way around that, making Venus a better option for long term colonization than Mars! How?

The Infinite Hotel, a thought experiment created by German mathematician David Hilbert, is a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. Easy to comprehend, right?  Wrong. What if it's completely booked but one person wants to check in? What about 40? Or an infinitely full bus of people? Jeff Dekofsky solves these heady lodging issues using Hilbert's paradox.

But the greatest challenge it faces continues to be Australia’s crisis over energy supply and cost. Who hasn’t been shocked by a recent electricity or gas bill? And who isn’t infuriated that power prices have risen so sharply? In a country as abundant with resources as ours it defies logic that there are now some Australians who can’t even pay for the electricity or gas to cook a simple meal. While federal – and state – politicians scramble to act, Elon Musk, the American billionaire with the brilliant mind, says he wants to help. In an exclusive interview with Liz Hayes, Musk says Australia’s energy emergency is easily fixable, and his construction of the world’s largest lithium ion battery at Jamestown in South Australia is proof.

Is there proof which you can do to see if the Earth is round? Recently, I have been getting a lot of comments on my channel from flat earthers saying the Earth can't be round. This got me wondering how exactly we know the Earth is round, excluding space agencies imagery. The result is this video. In my mind's eye this is conclusive proof. I really tried to do this from an unbiased perspective as I didn't want to bash on any group of people. I spent a long time researching and producing this so I hope you liked it!

Give yourself the gift of knowledge by subscribing to Big Think Edge: http://bit.ly/bigthinkedge

- If you see animals when you look at clouds or see faces in pieces of wood, that's called pareidolia: the phenomenon of making familiar objects from vague stimuli.

- Humans evolved to be superstitious, and Michio Kaku posits that there is a gene for superstition and magical thinking. Nine times out of 10, your beliefs can be wrong, but one time out of 10 it saved your ancestors' butts, says Kaku.

-Flat Earthers and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists exist now, and they will still exist in 1,000 years, says Kaku. It's natural. Humans evolved to believe in nonsense, but it's by becoming good at something totally unnatural to us – science – that reason can prevail.

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU).

He is the author of The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth (https://amzn.to/314zgD5)

HOW WOULD YOU ESCAPE NORTH KOREA? (THE 7 CHOICES)

If you were living in North Korea right now - trying to survive on a diet of rats, grass, soil and tree bark, quenching your thirst by drinking out of mud puddles in the ground - what would you do?

There's also the conceivable chance of being sent to a political prison camp for years on end just because you innocently thought out loud one day to a bunch of friends (North Korean propaganda is strong), where you are then beaten, tortured, and left so hungry that you are forced to dig and consume the grains out of faeces, or the maggots from dead bodies just so you have the energy to perhaps last one more day.

You'd probably wanna escape. But how?

The North Korean government in Pyongyang refuses to let its citizens leave, a clear violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, viewing North Korean defectors as traitorous criminals. Captured North Koreans would be subject to unimaginable torture and often public executions.

If they are successful in their escape, then three to four generations of their family back home would be sent to North Korean prison camps to rot ....or worse. This is a strong deterrent.

But this still doesn't stop desperate North Koreans from tempting fate. In this video, I'll go over the seven ways to escape the DPRK, including the most dangerous, the most unforgiving, the most unique, and the most unexpected.

The North Korean border on the south side (ie. South Korean border / Korean DMZ) is the shortest distance to travel for safety and stability but as a result, the regime makes it dangerously hard. A North Korean escapee can be shot down by North Korean soldiers (border guards) or step on the many landmines in the area.

The northern border to China has it's own set of challenges. Most North Korean refugees escape through this way, usually crossing the Tumen River border (like the famous North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee). Once in China, the nightmare doesn't end there.

There are also other, more unconventional ways you can try to escape such as through North Korean labor camps.

Even if you make it to safety and resettle in a stable country, the North Korean regime will still try to hunt you down, so you're never truly safe. Especially if you're an outspoken critic or a threat to Kim Jong-un's power - just ask his half brother, Kim Jong-nam",How Would You Escape North Korea?

A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.

Huge thanks to Hamza Khattak, Prof. Pablo Bianucci and Prof. Aaron Slepkov (unavailable for the call) for chatting to me and helping me understand the physics of this cool phenomenon.

""How fast are you moving?"" seems like an easy question, but it's actually quite complicated -- and perhaps best answered by another question: ""Relative to what?"" Even when you think you're standing still, the Earth is moving relative to the Sun, which is moving relative to the Milky Way, which is...you get the idea. Tucker Hiatt unravels the concepts of absolute and relative speed.

When Quasars were first discovered the amount of light pouring out of such a tiny dot in space seemed impossible. A hysterical flurry of hypothesizing followed: swarms of neutron stars, alien civilizations harnessing their entire galaxy’s power, bright, fast-moving objects being ejected by our own galaxy’s core. But by the 1980’s we were converging on the most awesome explanation. It goes a little like this: Take a black hole of millions to billions times the mass of the sun. Where from? It turns out every decent-sized galaxy has one at its core. Now drive gas into the galactic core. One way this can happen is when galaxies merge and grow. That gas descends into the waiting black hole’s gravitational well and gains incredible speed on the way. It is swept up in a raging whirlpool around the black hole that we call an accretion disk, where its energy of motion is turned into heat. The heat-glow of the accretion disk is so bright that we can see quasars to the ends of the universe.

Transcript - Matt Harden: Hey Bill, can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the earth is a sphere and not flat? I have a lot of Facebook friends who say that it's an act. Thank you.

Bill Nye: Is the earth flat or round? It's round. Now, let's see, how do we go about proving that? Go to the seashore. Go to the seashore and figure out why you can't, if you live on the East Coast figure out why you can't see Spain from the East Coast or North America? It looks like you might have a St. Louis hat on. I'm not sure. Just go to the middle of the Mississippi River and look south. Why can't you see Louisiana? Why can't you see New Orleans? What's the problem there? Then climb a tower or go to the top of a hill or a mountain and you'll see a little farther, but you will not see to the other side of the earth, places we know to exist. For example, I've been to London. I can tell you other people have. I've been to Vancouver British Columbia and you cannot see Vancouver British Columbia from Boise Idaho, let alone from New York City Or Toronto or what have you. Just start there then if you'd like look at pictures from space where you see the earth as a sphere. Those pictures are not faked. And I'll tell you if nothing else here is why you can tell they're not faked. Just to create the paperwork that NASA has created, NASA in this one case, just the paperwork to send anything out in space, to send people into orbit or to send them to the moon, that amount of paperwork would make faking it prohibitively expensive. No one could afford to generate that much documentation.

Then the other thing if you want to get into this, if your friends are really serious, have them get on a boat or a ship and go out at sea and you'll noticed you can't see infinitely far. Furthermore, if you get into it enough pick up a book about navigation or go online and learn about navigation. A very, very Important thing you have to take into account when you try to navigate the ocean from a ship or a boat is how high you are off the sea surface. The higher you are off the sea surface the farther you can see, the farther away the horizon is. Now, this discovery that the world is round was made - I'm going to say it was published in 1540. Now, I concerned - it was Copernicus, I'm concerned it might have been 1530, but it was about then. It was in the 16th century that the earth was shown to be a ball. But it was known to be a ball by a lot of other people before Copernicus in the Western World, what we now call the Western World the western hemisphere. The ancient Greeks noticed that from time to time the earth casts a shadow on the moon. This is a lunar eclipse's where the moon gets in the shadow of the earth, the sunlight is being blocked by the earth, the moon is on the far side of the earth. And that shadow is always curved. And the only shape that always produces a curve, no matter what the orientation, that is to say whether you're standing in Greece at night or if you're standing then 12 hours later in Buenos Aries at night, the shadow is always curved. So the ancient Greeks knew that the earth was a ball. They didn't know the size of it to the degree of precision we know now.

And you guys, come on, everybody watches newscasts. You all use mobile phones. You all see airplanes fly around. You all go to see Ed Sheeran in concert one day in London, another day in the Melbourne Australia. This all depends of our fundamental understanding of the size of the earth and its shape with extraordinary precision. And if you want to get into it the earth isn't quite a sphere, it's a little it's [NOISE], its spin is a [NOISE] stretched, it made it slightly oblate as the saying goes. This is all susceptible to analysis, but spend some time learning about navigation. Tell your friends to spend some time learning about navigation. Navigation has change the world, by the way. What are you wearing? You're wearing stuff that came from another part of the world on a ship. It didn't get here by magic, it got here through science.","Hey Bill Nye, ""How Do We Know the Earth Is Round?"" #TuesdaysWithBill",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oz7k7Wn_vo,-1,,-1,307,878227,15940,3005,0,14997,912169

flatearth,"Flat Earther Nathan Thompson works to recruit new believers - Daily Mail by Daily Mail 1 year ago 8 minutes, 26 seconds 60,980 views","One of the first lessons we learn in school is that the Earth is a globe that rotates on its axis and orbits the sun. But there is an ever-growing community of people who reject 'globehead' thinking and insist that the world is, in fact, flat. These 'Flat Earthers' believe that our planet is encircled by a giant, heavily-policed ice wall and that gravity is just an unproven theory. They also claim that NASA is a fraudulent organisation and that all the photographs and video footage we have from space are computer-generated imagery (CGI). The crazy - and scientifically disproven theory - will be laughable to most. Humans have known the earth is round for thousands of years, while ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the planet with surprising accuracy before his death in 195 BC.

flatearth,"Why do cylindrical rockets roll? by Everyday Astronaut 1 week ago 22 minutes 266,807 views","Here’s a fun question that not only have I myself asked, but I get asked fairly often, why do we hear a call out like “roger roll” or “roll program complete” at which point we can see the rocket rotate or roll on its X axis…

The best example of this was the Space Shuttle which had a very obvious and dramatic roll program. As soon as it cleared the tower, you can see it making a very impressive and sometimes scary looking roll. 

Now a maneuver like this makes sense when a vehicle is asymmetrical like the Space Shuttle, but why do cylindrical rockets like the Saturn V, Titan, Atlas, Delta IV etc etc even bother doing a roll? 

Can’t rockets just tip over in whatever direction they need to go? Do a little pitch here, a little yaw there just as long as the pointy end is going the direction it’s intended to go, who cares which side of the rocket is facing the Earth and which side is facing space… right? 

So today we’ll first define the pitch, yaw, roll and their corresponding axis on a rocket, then we’re going to dive into why a rocket rolls in the first place, take a look at launch azimuths and their relationships to trajectories and we’ll look at some unique solutions to orientations including some rockets that don’t roll on ascent to align with their trajectory.

In popular parlance the big bang has two meanings. First, big bang cosmology is the hypothesis that our universe has been expanding for 13.7 billion years from an extremely hot and dense primordial state-more extreme than the centre of a star or indeed anywhere now existing. This I have no quarrel with-it is established scientific fact which has been elaborated into a detailed story which narrates the expansion of the universe from an extremely uniform and dense hot plasma to the beautifully varied and complex world that is our home. We have detailed theories which pass numerous observational tests which explain the origins of all the structures we see from the elements to galaxies, stars, planets and the molecular building blocks of life itself. As in any good scientific theory there are questions still to be answered, such as the precise nature of the dark matter and dark energy which are prominent actors in the story, or the very interesting question of whether there was a very early phase of inflationary exponential expansion, but these do not suggest the basic picture could be wrong.",Mysteries of the Universe - The First Moment Of Time - Space Discovery Documentary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQEzxZ58_Nk,5,,0,4796,247726,1139,322,0,420,249607

If humans want to expand into space, it will take us incredible amounts of energy. How do we do that? Easy: we will just use the sun’s energy by realizing the most ambitious construction project in history. This is how it works.

According to the esteemed font of scholarly knowledge known as, Wikipedia, the Earth is an oblate spheroid. However, according to the Flat Earth Society who have the word “Earth” right there in their name, the Globe is actually a big flat disk, gravity is a lie and NASA is the most powerful commercial entity on Earth, which we think sounds a lot more likely than all of that “science” crap they taught us about in physics class.

flatearth,"Antarctica on the edge - earthrise by Al Jazeera English 1 year ago 24 minutes 86,100 views","Antarctica, one of the most remote and desolate locations on earth also functions as one of the world's main cooling systems. However, after decades of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, parts of the continent are now warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. 

Over the years, climate change has led to increased erosion of the continent, altered ocean currents and affected wildlife. Warmer currents are now flowing further south towards the icy terrain, contributing to glacial melt, rising sea levels and drastically changing habitats.

To understand how the region is changing, a group of 55 scientists commissioned by the Swiss Polar Institute have boarded the research vessel Academic Treshnikov to conduct 22 experiments around the continent. 

Tarek Bazley joins the group in Hobart and sets off on a month-long journey around Antarctica.

• Spinning discs are everywhere – just look at our solar system, the rings of Saturn, and all the spiral galaxies in the universe.
• Spinning discs are the result of two things: The force of gravity and a phenomenon in physics called the conservation of angular momentum.
• Gravity brings matter together; the closer the matter gets, the more it accelerates – much like an ice skater who spins faster and faster the closer their arms get to their body. Then, this spinning cloud collapses due to up and down and diagonal collisions that cancel each other out until the only motion they have in common is the spin – and voila: A flat disc.

Dr. Michelle Thaller is an astronomer who studies binary stars and the life cycles of stars. She is Assistant Director of Science Communication at NASA. She went to college at Harvard University, completed a post-doctoral research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, Calif. then started working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Spitzer Space Telescope. After a hugely successful mission, she moved on to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), in the Washington D.C. area. In her off-hours often puts on about 30lbs of Elizabethan garb and performs intricate Renaissance dances. For more information, visit NASA.

TRANSCRIPT

MICHELLE THALLER: Rick, you have noticed one of the most wonderful and consistent patterns in the whole universe. The universe is very good at making spinning discs. Our solar system is a disc, and all the planets go around in basically the same plane, and they all go around in the same direction. Why should that be?

There are discs all over the place. I mean, think about the rings of Saturn. The rings of Saturn are also very, very thin, and they all go around in the same direction. Galaxies, spiral galaxies are one big disc with everything moving around a common center. Discs seem to be something that the universe likes to make. And, in fact, that really is true. And it has to do with a number of things. It has to do with the force of gravity and something called the conservation of angular momentum.

Now, gravity is very good at bringing stuff together and bringing it together so it becomes denser and denser and begins to fall into the center. Our solar system formed out of a giant cloud of dust and gas about 4 and 1/2 billion years ago. It was actually many trillions of miles across at first..

The silence of the galaxy and the resulting Fermi Paradox has perplexed us for nearly 50 years. But our most recent surveys of the Milky Way finally allow us to draw scientific conclusions about the depressingly persistent absence of aliens.

When Enrico Fermi uttered the words, “Where is everybody?” he was succinctly summarizing what has become known as the Fermi paradox. In short: in a galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, each of which having billions of years to spawn life and civilization, isn’t it odd that none have made themselves apparent to us. Enrico Fermi was, supposedly, using this as an argument against the plausibility of interstellar travel. If aliens can travel between the stars, why haven’t they visited? But the paradox is much broader than this.  There are several ways that an advanced civilization could give away their presence. Radio transmissions, robotic probes, or star-blotting solar arrays. A series of very recent surveys of our galaxy reveal none of the above, while at the same time proving the abundance of potentially habitable worlds. The Fermi paradox has become only more paradoxical, and these surveys are finally powerful enough to draw some serious conclusions about the rarity of advanced civilizations AND about the chance of us ever becoming one.

Are we alone in the universe? When the mental gears really start moving, people can come up with theories that are downright terrifying! In this video, you'll learn about 13 of the scariest theories that’ll make you question everything you thought you knew about your reality.

TIMESTAMPS: 
The Great Filter 1:28
Higher dimensional beings 2:33
False Vacuum 3:23
We're living in a black hole 4:10
White Holes 4:50
The Multiverse Theory 5:25
Brain in a Vat 6:03
Roko's Basilisk 6:48
The Transcension Hypothesis 7:21
The Terror Management Theory 8:00
The Sixth Mass Extinction 8:35
The Fermi Paradox 9:17
The Simulation Theory 10:00

SUMMARY:
- According to The Great Filter theory, somewhere out there exists a Great Filter. The main purpose of this Filter is to stop those civilizations that advance to the level of star colonization.
- What if a 4D being was looking at you from their four-dimensional world? Just like a 2D person, you wouldn't be able to notice this creature in your 3D world.
- The False Vacuum theory says that our universe exists in a false phase state, which means that it's just a temporary thing. What's more, it's only a small part of a larger universe.
- You’re probably well-aware that black holes suck in everything around them. But what happens to the stuff it engulfs? What if a black hole already swallowed us up long ago? Surprisingly, some physicists deem this theory pretty plausible.
- While black holes engulf all matter so that even light can’t escape, white holes are quite the opposite. These formations are believed to spit out everything that black holes suck in.
- The Multiverse theory claims that there might be countless other realities besides our own.
- The Brain in a Vat theory says that you very well could just be a brain in a jar. Something is feeding you false impulses, and you're hallucinating your whole life and reality.
- Roko's Basilisk is a hypothesis that some future super-powerful artificial intellect can retroactively punish people who struggled against it in the past (which is our present) or even those who did nothing to help bring it about.
- The Transcension Hypothesis states that a civilization eventually gets to a certain intellectual level.
- According to the Terror Management theory, everything we do comes from the fear of death. Our wishes and motivation are based on just one thing, and it’s the idea that one day we will stop existing.
- The Sixth Mass Extinction theory is probably the most horrifying. Yet, unfortunately, it’s the most probable scenario. Some biologists believe that humanity is headed for or already passing through the sixth mass extinction
- The Fermi Paradox theory explains why we probably wouldn't recognize an advanced alien civilization even if it was right under our nose.
- According to the Simulation theory, we all live in an incredibly complex computer game.

flatearth,"Why I’ve Been Injecting Snake Venom for 30 Years by VICE 3 months ago 5 minutes, 54 seconds 540,923 views","Steve Ludwin has been voluntarily injecting snake venom for 30 years. This began as a quest for personal immunity, the fountain of youth and the acquiring of serpent powers but became considerably more profound when a laboratory in Copenhagen discovered his masochism. 

Now, his blood is in trials to be potentially used as a worldwide antivenom which could save thousands of lives. In the run up to the release of VICE's new three-part series Snake and Man, Steve breaks down why he started injecting venom, why he looks 20 years younger and how he may have accidentally become an antivenom messiah.

flatearth,"When Will Time End? by SpaceRip 6 years ago 25 minutes 4,101,450 views","The answer to this question may depend on whether Stephen Hawking was right in his theory that describes how black holes shed mass and eventually decay. Time is flying by on this busy, crowded planet as life changes and evolves from second to second. At the same time, the arc of the human lifespan is getting longer: 67 years is the global average, up from just 20 years in the Stone Age.

Modern science provides a humbling perspective. Our lives, indeed even that of the human species, are just a blip compared to the Earth, at 4.5 billion years and counting, and the universe, at 13.7 billion years.

It now appears the entire cosmos is living on borrowed time. It may be a blip within a much grander sweep of time. When, we now ask, will time end? 

Our lives are governed by cycles of waking and sleeping, the seasons, birth and death. Understanding time in cyclical terms connects us to the natural world, but it does not answer the questions of science.

What explains Earth's past, its geological eras and its ancient creatures? And where did our world come from? How and when will it end? In the revolutions spawned by Copernicus and Darwin, we began to see time as an arrow, in a universe that's always changing. 

The 19th century physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann, found a law he believed governed the flight of Time's arrow. Entropy, based on the 2nd law of thermodynamics, holds that states of disorder tend to increase.

From neat, orderly starting points, the elements, living things, the earth, the sun, the galaxy. are all headed eventually to states of high entropy or disorder. Nature fights this inevitable disintegration by constantly reassembling matter and energy into lower states of entropy in cycles of death and rebirth. 

Will entropy someday win the battle and put the breaks on time's arrow? Or will time, stubbornly, keep moving forward? 

We are observers, and pawns, in this cosmic conflict. We seek mastery of time's workings, even as the clock ticks down to our own certain end. Our windows into the nature of time are the mechanisms we use to chart and measure a changing universe, from the mechanical clocks of old, to the decay of radioactive elements, or telescopes that measure the speed of distant objects. 

Our lives move in sync with the 24-hour day, the time it takes the Earth to rotate once. Well, it's actually 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds if you're judging by the stars, not the sun. Earth got its spin at the time of its birth, from the bombardment of rocks and dust that formed it. But it's gradually losing it to drag from the moon's gravity.

When the very first balloon was launched that could carry people it was in Paris in the late 1700s and it was Montgolfier the brothers, they had hydrogen balloons and hot air balloons and it was the cutting edge of science. It was the cutting edge of technology. We just learned how to capture a gas like hydrogen that would be lighter than air as you could take a balloon and the first balloon rose and Ben Franklin was there and it was huge and magnificent, all of those scientists. And it rose but it got out of control and it went and landed out in the countryside 15 miles away from Paris and the peasants there attacked it with pitchforks because they thought it was an alien coming from space. The schism between learned understanding and scientific pursuit and the common perception of what was normal was that close just 15 miles away. It was an enormous gap between what we knew and what we were doing and what a lot of folks knew yet or what had become part of common knowledge. So there's nothing new about the speed with which we're inventing things and the ability for people to understand what's going on. There's a recent populous sort of wave of anti-science as if that's something new. It's mostly because social media has given everybody what appears to be an equal voice. On the corner of Hyde Park in London there's Speakers Corner and that used to be the Internet where you could go stand there and yell any stupid thing you wanted and if people wanted to gather around and listen that was their choice, but if you weren't interested in whatever that person was spouting then you didn't need to listen. But now the Internet has sort of turned everything into the Speakers Corner so you really have to just decide what are you going to listen to and what aren't you. And if someone decides to put forward some stupid idea that is patently false like if somebody says the sky is orange, you can have an argument about it if you want, but it's obviously not true so there's really no point in even engaging in conversation. Or if somebody says the world is flat, it's patently untrue so there's no point in engaging in conversation because all you're doing is giving that person credibility for something that we've known for thousands of years to not be truth. I don't even worry about it. The world is full of fascinating interesting new discoveries and we're pushing the very boundaries of what we know. Stephen Hawking, who just recently died, the work that he did in trying to understand how the universe works the original thinking there's so many brilliant motivated people around that's why would you engage with someone who is being deliberately ignorant? I don't mind people that just don't know when they're just in the process of learning, but if someone has chosen to take the facts and be deliberately stupid about them then I think they've discounted themselves from rational conversation so I don't bother. If you wrestle with a pig the best you can be is a pig wrestler; I want to do better than that. So just because somebody says something, no matter how big their megaphone is, it doesn't mean that they deserve conversation. Just use your own brain, that's why we each have one, and choose who you're going to disregard.",Chris Hadfield: The astronaut's guide to flat Earth theory,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOfcyYlQzZk,-1,,-1,211,240041,5560,1064,0,3729,250394

Hey flat Earthers, it's time to put your theory to bed once and for all! A curious stargazer by the name of Oscar has submitted a question to Big Think's 'Ask an astronomer' series with NASA's Michelle Thaller. Oscar wants to know: ""What would be the easiest proof that the Earth isn’t flat, that I could come back with whenever I get challenged on this issue?"" Thaller sets the record straight.

So, Oscar, you asked the question, “What are some of the easiest ways that you can prove that the Earth is round?” Because apparently, this is something that we’re debating—I have no idea why.

That’s a hard thing for me to even start talking about because there are so many proofs that the Earth is round, it’s difficult to know where to start. And it’s not okay to think that the Earth is flat. This is not a viable argument.

I have friends who have been on the International Space Station, they have orbited the Earth once every 90 minutes; I've had personal experience with people who have been up in space and can see with their own eyes that the Earth is round. And of course, we‘ve taken all of these amazing pictures from space; they’re so beautiful, all those pictures of the Earth.

So I don’t really know what’s going on right now with this 'Earth is flat' thing, but I will tell you that this is one of the things I really enjoyed teaching my own astronomy class about because there are proofs all around you. It is not difficult to know that the Earth is round. In fact, people have known of this for way more than 2,000 years. The ancient Greeks actually had a number of really elegant, wonderful proofs that the earth was a sphere. 

So let’s start from the simple to the slightly more complicated. One of the things you can see yourself, with a pair of binoculars, is if you actually go out to a lake and there are boats on that lake, the farther away a boat is the more the bottom of the boat will disappear, and you’ll basically just see the mast of the boat. And as a boat goes farther and farther away the last thing you will see is the very top of the mast of that boat, and that’s because the boat is actually going over the horizon that’s curved—and that means that as it goes farther and farther away you see less and less of the bottom of it, and more of the top of that. You can see that with binoculars by an ocean, by a lake, it’s really easy. That wouldn’t happen if the Earth were flat—you would simply see the boat getting smaller and smaller and smaller as it went farther away, but you’d be able to see the whole thing with the same proportions.

Now, another way that you can tell that we’re on a sphere is to think about how there’s something called the tropics on the Earth, and the tropics are places near the equator of the earth were sometimes the sun is overhead in the sky. This was actually something that the Greeks used, not only to prove that the Earth was round about 2000 years ago, but they actually measured the circumference of the Earth, accurate to within just a couple percent. 2,000 years ago we’ve known that the Earth was round.

There was a really brilliant Greek scientist called Eratosthenes, and Eratosthenes noticed that there was a town called Syene, and on a certain date the sun would actually shine straight down to the bottom of a well. That meant the sun was directly overhead; you could look down a well and see the sun shining back at you.

And on the very same date, farther away in the city of Alexandria, that didn’t happen. The sun was not directly overhead, it was a slight angle, and all that Eratosthenes did was he measured the difference in the angle of the sun. It was straight overhead in Syene; in Alexandria it was a little bit less than overhead, and he rationed that that change in angle from one city to another was probably indicative of us being on a curved surface, and you could make all kinds of measurements even between those two cities and see that the angles were different—the sun was at a different place in the sky. Using this, he actually measured the circumference of the Earth, and he got it right 2,000 years ago.

So another really simple proof is that on any given date, at different cities and different places around the world, the sun is at different angles in the sky. That wouldn’t happen if the Earth wasn’t round.",3 proofs that debunk flat-Earth theory | NASA's Michelle Thaller,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjFAe018oA,-1,,-1,425,894872,16252,9772,0,58565,979461

You claim the boat and wind turbines should be leaning away yet the angle would be less than 1% (Ask a 10 year old to work it out for you). 
You claim the distortion and ""perspective"" means this video does not disprove a flat earth. Not only is this a lie but isn't it an amazing coincidence that the only easily checkable thing just happens to look identical on a flat earth and also a globe? 
Do you really think that a multitude of ever changing Govts around the world with diverse leaders such as Trump, Obama, Putin, Kim Jong-un, Xi Jinping etc would all agree to keep up the same lie?

When it comes to the earth being flat, humans of average intelligence often have what sound to be like very valid questions:
1. If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?
2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?
3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?
4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 
5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?

These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

flatearth,"People From Around The Globe Met For The First Flat Earth Conference (HBO) by VICE News 1 year ago 4 minutes, 1 second 1,711,355 views","Conspiracy theories are nothing new, but in the age of the internet, they spread like “chemtrails” in the wind.  The theory that the world is flat, for example, gained so much popularity online that this year 500 people gathered for the first ever International Flat Earth Conference.

The belief that the world is flat has kind of been around forever, but it picked up steam in 2015 with a rash of online communities, YouTube videos, podcasts, and even songs preaching the gospel. At some point, Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics started talking about it too, which really seemed to blow the lid off the heliocentric model.

So, the time was right for the Flat Earth International Conference, the first of its kind, held at the beginning of November outside of Raleigh, NC. Sold out since May, the conference brought together hundreds of people who had before only really interacted online.
It was an opportunity for believers to network, share research, meet thought leaders, find a flat-earth compatible mate, show off various NASA parody t-shirts, and talk shit about Neil deGrasse Tyson.

VICE News was there for it all. As one attendee told us, “it gets pretty deep.” We'll let you be the judge.

We asked him what he thought of flat earth theory, a school of thought which believes that the earth is not spherical but flat.

""All our physics is constructed now, the physics of orbits of things going around the earth is all constructed with this three dimensional world. And the pictures from space show our world as a globe and yet somehow there are some people that still seem to believe the earth is flat.""

""My own pet theory is that they’re doing it for comic effect.""

This is the ultimate buddy movie. November 14, 1969... three astronauts with spacesuits, food, water, and a battery of scientific and communications equipment prepared to fly to the moon. Thousands gathered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, including President and Mrs. Richard Nixon, to witness the historic launch. It was raining that day, but that was no cause for delay. The ship that would carry them into space was designed to launch in any weather.  

But how would it respond to a powerful electrical storm now gathering above the launch pad? That was just the beginning of the incredible journey of Apollo 12. 

With three astronauts fastened into their seats, the countdown proceeded. Astronaut and Mission Commander Pete Conrad would say later: ""The flight was extremely normal, for the first 36 seconds."" The five engines of the Saturn 5's huge first stage were designed to burn through 5 million pounds of liquid oxygen in just two and a half minutes, and to send the spacecraft up 67 kilometers above the Atlantic Ocean. 

When it reached an altitude of 2000 meters, something unexpected happened. Racing through the stormy environment, the rocket generated a lightning bolt that traveled down its highly conductive exhaust trail. 

Another bolt hit 16 seconds later. All of the spacecraft's circuit breakers shut off. The tracking system was lost. A young flight controller in Houston, Texas instructed astronaut Alan Bean on how to turn on an auxiliary power system. The mission was back on track. Once in Earth orbit, all systems appeared to check out, and flight control officials gave the crew the green light to leave Earth.

The astronauts were not told of concern that the lighting strikes had damaged the pyrotechnic system used to deploy the parachutes that would ease them back through the Earth's atmosphere. If that system failed, the astronauts would not return alive.

This mission would have its share of perils, not unlike those faced by a long line of past explorers, whose courage and restless spirit propelled them into the unknown. This one, however, was backed by years of technology development, test flights, astronaut training, and the largest support team back home that any mission ever had.

But hundreds of thousands of kilometers out in space the three astronauts were pretty much on their own. What made Apollo 12 unique was the friendship and chemistry of its crew. Conrad, Bean, and Richard Gordon were all Navy men. Working and training together on the Gemini program, they had gained each other's respect and trust. 

Now, hurtling across more than 400,000 kilometers to the moon, they prepared to fullfill the mission's goals. One was to set up a scientific station designed to record seismic, atmospheric, and solar data. 

Another was to visit an unmanned lunar probe called Surveyor III that had landed there two and a half years before. The idea was to bring back a part to study the effect of the lunar environment. 

A third goal was to improve on the landing of Apollo 11 just 5 months before. Dropping down over a region called the Sea of Tranquility, pilot Neil Armstrong found himself heading straight for a crater full of boulders. He had to fly over the planned landing site and find a new one. Now kilometers beyond the target, the lander, called Eagle, was literally running out of gas.

With less than 30 seconds of fuel left, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin finally touched down on a landscape obscured by dust stirred up by the vehicle's thrusters.  Future astronauts would have to be able to make precision landings at locations dictated by science. That meant they would have to touch down on landscapes filled with all kinds of rocks and craters.

For Apollo 12, the science pointed to a region known as the Ocean of Storms, some 2000 kilometers from where the Eagle had landed. Here, the landscape is dark from lava that cooled to form its flat expanse billions of years ago.",The Incredible Journey of Apollo 12 - 4K,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g6X4Dzos5E,5,0/moonlanding,0,1502,57470,954,73,0,401,58898

So let's think about it a different way, using something we see and interact with every day… light.

While we imagine light to be instantaneous, photons of light actually take time to travel from one side of the room to the other.

In the time it took you to read this far, a photon of light leaving the Sun has travelled about 10 million kilometres – equivalent to travelling around the Earth 250 times.

Light that leaves our second nearest star, Proxima Centauri, takes just over four years to reach Earth and so we can define it as four light years away.

As such, if you were to look at Proxima Centauri, you would not be seeing the star as it is right now, but how it 'was' 4 years ago!

We see all things in the universe as they were in the past, whether they're on the other side of the room or the other side of the galaxy.

To take this concept further, the nearest large galaxy to us is Andromeda which is so big and close that you can see it in the night sky with your naked eye.

What you're really seeing is 1,000's of billions of stars in a configuration similar to our Milky Way. However, all of those stars are about 2.5 million light years away, which means you're seeing Andromeda as it was 2.5 million years ago.",How Large is the Universe? & The Birth of New Galaxy - Space Discovery Documentary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpu4VSdoV6s,5,,0,0,68131,363,51,0,0,68545

When he found out that Tesla would not service or support his salvaged cars, he took it upon himself to scour the internet and harvest working parts from several busted Teslas. He Frankensteined them together until his creations were fully operational, at a fraction of what it would cost to buy a new or certified pre-owned Tesla. 

Motherboard travels to Massachusetts to meet with the rogue mechanic leading a grassroots movement of DIY fixers who are taking back the right to repair the things they own.

Frank Turek (Cross Examined on youtube) is a Christian apologist who recycles old, tired apologetics like William Paley's watchmaker analogy and the teleological argument when his views are challenged. Here, Turek goes up against Douglas Adams' puddle analogy as a response to claims of intelligent design. Frank thinks DNA is a code or message made by god, as there's ""no other explanation for it."" The issue is, Turek is unfamiliar with the basics evolution, and how DNA evolves. Here, we see apologetics fired out in a rapid patter, creating a concise piece of Christian propaganda. I'm here to debunk it.

flatearth,"Is Time Travel Possible? | Unveiled by Unveiled 1 year ago 10 minutes 3,112,135 views","Is Time Travel Possible?
Subscribe: https://goo.gl/GmtyPv

Everyone has thought about time travel at least once in their life. Maybe you’ve wanted to go back in time and try to change something from your past. There’s even a lot of science fiction movies out there that involve time travel, or were inspired by time travel in some way or another. But is it really possible to travel back or forward in time? And if it really is possible, what would we have to do in order to make time travel a reality? 

The very thought about time travel and what it would take to make it a reality is mind-boggling. It is something that scientists, especially astrophysicists, have long thought about. The most fantastic thing? It's probably possible. We should probably start off with the bad news about time travel. We probably can’t travel back in time and watch the Egyptians build the pyramids. However, there are a number of theories that have suggested that it is possible to take a leap forward in time. But going back in time is far more complicated. That’s not saying it’s impossible though. 

The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. While most people think of time as a constant, Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative in that it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but other scientists have confirmed this theory. The theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing which is called ‘space-time’. There is a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels this speed limit through empty space. 

So more about this illusion of time, ‘Special Relativity’ says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. You won't notice this effect until you return to those stationary people. 

So as an experiment, let’s say you were 15 years old and you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about close to the speed of light, and you celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you got home at the age of 20, you would find that all your classmates who were the same age as you when you left were 65 years old, retired, and hanging out with their grandchildren! The reason for this is because as time passed more slowly for you, you would have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years.",Is Time Travel Possible? | Unveiled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjOAE6FFVTo,5,,0,616,3141464,37994,1544,0,6943,3187945

See the official NASA Space Station Tour:
https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/suni_iss_tour.html

A little behind the scenes for this video, early on animating that little mini map Eisen my animator discovered even small errors were very noticeable and distracted from the tour if the map wasn't reflecting reality within a few degrees.  Animating anything for 10 minutes is a big deal so instead of trial and error, he put what he knew about the rules of perspective and made this grid system to line things up, all to make the dots on that map in the corner work like you'd expect them to.

The thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education. Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!

I’m very grateful to mathematician Hugh Woodin, Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics at Harvard, for taking the time on multiple occasions to discuss this topic with me and help me wrap my (finite) head around it.

I’m also grateful to David Eisenbud, the Director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) and professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, for his help and for connecting me with Hugh Woodin.

And of course, big thanks to Brady Haran who created the “mile of pi” seen in this video and connected me with all these mathematicians in the first place. His channel, Numberphile, is superb: https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile

Most of us take gravity as an assumed part of our living realities, but why? Basic physics introduces us to the concept of gravity from a Newtonian sense, but when you start factoring Einstein into an understanding of gravity, things get… weird. For example, gravity may simply not exist. Why? Watch this week’s episode of PBS Space Time and find out why gravity may be an illusion!

We’re living in a brief window of time where our planet isn’t frozen underneath a giant layer of glaciers. How much longer will the moderate climate that we’ve come to know as “normal” continue? What causes these dramatic shifts in temperature that thaw our planet and then throw it back into a state of deep freeze? This episode looks at how the changes in our planet’s orbit and rotation impacts our climate.

We’ve been failing to detect dark matter for decades. Finally, the latest failure to detect dark matter may have actually proved its existence. One of these is true: either most of the matter in the universe is invisible and formed of something not explained by modern particle physics OR our understanding of gravity is completely broken. The debate over which is true has raged for decades, but may finally have been resolved in an unlikely way: the proof that dark matter exists, and really is an exotic, unknown substance, may have come from the discovery of two galaxies that appear to have no dark matter at all. Today on Space Time Journal Club we’ll look at the papers that reveal this discovery:

The effect of dark matter was first noticed in 1933, when the legendary Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky noticed that the galaxies in the Coma cluster were moving too quickly to remain gravitationally bound within that cluster. He guessed the presence of “dunkle m aterie” – a dark matter invisible to his telescope but whose gravitational effect held the cluster together. As with many of Zwicky’s predictions – like the existence of neutron stars and gravitational lensing - this wasn’t taken seriously until decades later. The hunt for dark matter began in earnest after the early 70s when Vera Ruben, discovered that the rotation rates of spiral galaxies were too fast given the mass of their visible stars alone. They should throw themselves to pieces spinning that quickly – that is, unless, a gravitational force of unseen origin was holding them together.

Now that we have a primer on the aspects of the Big Bang Theory that we know definitely happened, let’s look further into what we don’t yet know, and how the theory could progress in the future. Since there is a discrepancy between general relativity and quantum mechanics, we continue to search for a grand unifying theory... one which may finally lead to a description of the actual moment of the Big Bang! On this week's Space Time, Matt describes what specifically needs fixing within the current theory, and the reasons why.

Unlikely. Even if you ask a 10-year-old, they’ll tell you exactly what took down the gigantic ship. However, some survivors of the sinking legend would beg to differ. Here’s one of their stories, and it has nothing to do with an iceberg.

Armenian publicist Vaghinak Byurat was 25 years old in the spring of 1912. He described what happened on his journey to America on the most famous ship in the world in his memoirs. He’s never mentioned an iceberg hitting the Titanic, and always spoke about an explosion. And if what he said was true, something must have caused that huge explosion...

SUMMARY:
- Armenian publicist Vaghinak Byurat was 25 years old in the spring of 1912. He described what happened on his journey to America on the most famous ship in the world in his memoirs.
- In 1912, Vaghinak published some books together with his father, a famous Armenian writer. His task was to take the books to America.
- They went to bed rather late on April 14, just like on the other nights. Shortly after midnight, something that sounded like a big explosion woke everyone up.
- None of the crew members wanted to say anything, but a few minutes later it was impossible to deny that the Titanic was going underwater.
- Vaghinak put his passport and money in a little bag and tied it around his neck. The Titanic’s bow was already underwater by that time. A lot of people in this situation wouldn’t have dared to take it to the open water.
- The water in the North Atlantic that night was just below freezing, at a scary 28 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 C). The young writer felt his arms and legs go numb, and he was understandably getting weaker and weaker every second.
- Then, he bumped into something. It was a lifeboat! But it was so overcrowded they pushed the young man with a paddle when he tried to stick to the boat.
- Vaghinak woke up alive on board another ship. That ship was the Carpathia, and it was en route to New York with lucky survivors on board.
- 12 days later, a woman came into the room. She turned out to be the person who saved Vaghinak. Missis Astor told the sailors that the young man was her son, and she wouldn’t let them go without him since she’d already lost her husband on the Titanic.
- Vaghinak lived a long and happy life and, as a great storyteller, he shared what happened to him many times. Interestingly, he’s never mentioned an iceberg hitting the Titanic, and always spoke about an explosion.
- It could have been a fire, and quite a lot of people actually believe that theory, saying that coal was burning in the ship’s hull.
- Another theory that explained the explosion claimed that there was a German U-boat involved in the sinking of Titanic.

It seems like every year, there's more new UFO footage online. With photo and video editing programs being easy to obtain and learn, it's hard to take any proof seriously. However, some footage is just too outlandish to ignore. So today  I'm going to countdown the most bizarre UFO sightings. I'm not saying these clips are authentic proof of alien life, and I'm not trying to convince you. But this interests me, so I'm making a video about it. This is The Top 20 Most Bizarre UFO Sightings.

An unidentified flying object, or UFO, in its most general definition, is any apparent anomaly in the sky that is not identifiable as a known object or phenomenon. Culturally, UFOs are associated with claims of visitation by extraterrestrial life or government-related conspiracy theories, and have become popular subjects in fiction. While UFOs are often later identified, sometimes identification may not be possible owing to the usually low quality of evidence related to UFO sightings (generally anecdotal evidence and eyewitness accounts).

Stories of fantastical celestial apparitions have been told since antiquity, but the term ""UFO"" (or ""UFOB"") was officially created in 1953 by the United States Air Force (USAF) to serve as a catch-all for all such reports. In its initial definition, the USAF stated that a ""UFOB"" was ""any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object."" Accordingly, the term was initially restricted to those fraction of cases which remained unidentified after investigation, as the USAF was interested in potential national security reasons and/or ""technical aspects."" (See Air Force Regulation 200-2.) During the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often referred to popularly as ""flying saucers"" or ""flying discs"". The term UFO became more widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the Cold War, an era associated with a heightened concern for national security. Various studies have concluded that the phenomenon does not represent a threat to national security nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit (e.g., 1951 Flying Saucer Working Party, 1953 CIA Robertson Panel, USAF Project Blue Book, Condon Committee).

flatearth,"The Earth is Definitely Not Flat by Professor Dave Explains 2 months ago 13 minutes 109,702 views","Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?

We welcome your comments on the open blog thread for this show. 
► http://freethoughtblogs.com/axp/

YouTube comments are at present disabled in our channel, to the displeasure of some. However, each video has a prominent link to the associated open thread that appears on our blog. In the past we've tried opening up the channel to comments, but we found that a very high number of episodes wound up being flooded with a combination of spam, long winded apologists, and various obscene or misogynistic comments directed at various hosts by people with an axe to grind. This seems to be the nature of YouTube comment sections, in our experience.

We do moderate the blog, the same way that we moderate chat during the show, as well as comments on our Facebook group. For comment sections that are ""officially"" associated with our show (and, to a much lesser extent, channels that may give the unintended appearance of being official), we prefer not to play host to straight up ad hominem attacks and bigotry. As a general policy we do not block commenters simply on the basis of disagreement with our point of view. However, we do prefer discussion environments that don't actively chase off more reasonable contributors.

WHAT IS THE ATHEIST EXPERIENCE?

The Atheist Experience is a weekly call-in television show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist audience. The Atheist Experience is produced by the Atheist Community of Austin.

The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.

We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.

Is there just one universe or many? In this series we explore competing models for what happened at or before the big bang. In this episode we interview Alex Vilenkin who proposed the universe had a spontaneous origin from “nothing"" and with no cause! He also showed how our big bang would not be alone, that there would be an infinite number of big bangs generating a multiverse. The idea of a universe from nothing has of course been discussed elsewhere. But here we clear up many misunderstandings of the concept with the scientist who invented it. In particular, the proposal that the universe came from nothing is not to be confused with the proposal that the universe originated from a vacuum fluctuation. Below is lit of topics we discuss. Please note we did not release the film until Alex Vilenkin saw a draft and approved it.

↓↓↓More info and sources below ↓↓↓

In part 2 of our special series on human ancestry, we ask why we are the only surviving branch on the human evolutionary tree. Just 50,000-100,000 years ago, Earth was home to three or four separate human species, including our most famous cousins: the Neanderthals. New research has shown that Neanderthals were not the brutish, unintelligent cavemen that cartoons make them out to be. They were creative, smart, social, and perhaps even had complex language. So why did they go extinct as soon as Homo sapiens moved into their territory? Does any trace of them live on today? Why don’t we have Neanderthal neighbors?

Loki the mischief-maker, writhes in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife and shorn off her beautiful hair. To fix what he’d done, Loki rushes to the dwarves and tricks them into making gifts for the gods. Wanting to best their smith rivals, the dwarves make a set of golden treasures, including a hammer called Mjolnir. Scott A. Mellor traces the legend of Thor’s hammer.

Hello there! My name is Joana. Right now I am going to tell you a story of how I almost ruined my family, I thought, but got involved in the biggest embarrassment of my life instead.

This is Hannah, my best friend. While this story was happening, she was going through one of the toughest periods in any teenager’s life – her parents’ divorce. And I was trying to do my best to support her. Back then, we would usually spend our days and nights discussing all the patterns of Hannah’s dad’s behavior, upon which her mom had finally guessed that he was cheating on her. For example, he’d started returning home late from “work,” as he’d been calling it. Or he’d received strange phone calls, and then he would go hide in the weirdest places around the house so no one could hear him.

Well, you know, to me this resembled a lot of the stuff that usually happens in any cheap soap opera. So once, I’d wondered how come Hannah’s mom couldn’t have figured out earlier that he was lying to her. Why wouldn't she have been suspicious for almost the whole year that it was happening? I said if I were in her place, I would be able to recognize cheating just like that. This statement had actually made my friend a little irritated and offended, and we had a big fight.

Anyway, this situation with her parents had made me slightly interested in my own dad’s behavior. I mean, his relationship seemed good with my mom and there was nothing to worry about in terms of a divorce or anything. I just wanted to have some fun and had started to sort of shadow my dad. You might call me a worrywart, but once I took a closer look, my dad turned out to be pretty suspicious.
You know, he had recently switched to another job connected to security somehow. And his working schedule since then had become an after dark one. But what was actually strange, that I hadn’t noticed before, was that during the daytime he’d begun spending a few hours at the gym on a daily basis. I mean, why he would need to go there every day, instead of once or twice a week like everybody else does. I’d also noticed that once, when his cellphone rang, the name “BB” popped up, and he rushed out of the room so that I couldn't hear what he was going to talk about with that BB. Wasn’t that strange?

Of course, I had to share this information with someone and I told everything to Hannah. Based on her own experience, she immediately said that my dad was also a cheater and that my parents would also soon be divorced. I told her she was nuts, but to be honest, I couldn’t say that I totally thought that she was wrong. I knew that I needed to get more pieces of evidence for any of my suspicions to be proven. So once, when dad returned home from his usual gym session, Hannah and I were at home and she forced me to rummage through his athletic bag. I know, I know, this was totally inappropriate, but I’d struck at the right moment and the thing I’d found in there had actually irreversibly changed my life.

It was a pink blouse. I felt a cold sweat cover my whole back. It all fit. I didn’t want to believe my eyes. Of course, I put that “thing” back, as if I’d touched nothing, and rushed to my room. Silent tears were teasing me, but when I saw Hannah sitting there on my bed and looking at me as if she was dying to know what I’d learned, I just cried hard. I couldn’t believe that Hannah was right. I can’t be the daughter of a liar and traitor. Hannah tried to cheer me up and say that finally everything was going to be OK for everybody and then I immediately thought about my mom. Even though Hannah said she was thinking that I had no right to keep this a secret, I wasn’t sure this was actually anything that was my business.

These doubts were torturing me for the next couple of days. I couldn’t stop thinking about that situation. A couple of times I’d even found myself trying to imagine what that other woman looked like. I don’t know why, but I thought that she was a tall curly blonde with enormously huge semi-permanent eyelashes and Botox-ed lips. I could neither sleep nor eat well, and I couldn’t stand my dad anywhere near me, even at the dining table, so that at some point, when my mom had asked me what was wrong I couldn’t help but start crying. 
When I finally managed to tell her about all of my worries about my dad, surprisingly she just sighed and said that we should have had this talk a long time ago. I was listening to her with my mouth wide open from the shocking information I’d gotten about my dad. Mom said that BB was the nickname of dad’s boss and that this blouse had actually belonged to my dad. He would wear it from time to time at work.

How Electric Motors Work
http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/motor1.htm
“An el­ectric motor is all about magnets and magnetism: A motor uses magnets to create motion. If you have ever played with magnets you know about the fundamental law of all magnets: Opposites attract and likes repel.”

Braking
http://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Braking
“Removing the kinetic energy can be accomplished by dissipating the energy to the atmosphere through friction or by converting it into another form of energy. The most common type of braking is a mechanical brake which inhibits motion through friction brake pads. “

How Regenerative Braking Works
http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking.htm
“At present, these kinds of brakes are primarily found in hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius, and in fully electric cars, like the Tesla Roadster. In vehicles like these, keeping the battery charged is of considerable importance. However, the technology was first used in trolley cars and has subsequently found its way into such unlikely places as electric bicycles and even Formula One race cars.”

In 1961 when President Kennedy pledged to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade, no rocket existed with the power or capability to rise to the challenge. In order to win the race to space, the United States would need to establish a multi-billion dollar space program.

One man, Werner Von Braun believed he had the knowledge and vision to make Kennedy's dream a reality.

With the American public galvanised and the expertise of over 200,000 scientists and engineers, Von Braun masterminded the development of the Saturn V; the rocket that flew 24 men to the moon and launched the greatest adventure in the history of exploration.

This is the story of the most powerful machine ever built, and the men and women who believed it could fly.

Using visual effects, stunning NASA footage and expert interviews with Apollo Space Scientists, this inspirational film tells the story of the colossal challenges NASA faced to fulfill Kennedy's pledge.

With the accolade of flying 24 men safely to the moon, the mighty Saturn V will always be considered one of mankind's greatest technological achievements.

In order to keep your spacecraft alive in that environment, you need electricity to keep it warm. Not to mention all the power to run scientific instruments and the transmitters to send that data home.

Getting enough power in space is a big problem.

moonlanding,"Life in the universe | The Economist by The Economist 3 years ago 10 minutes 429,694 views","Does life exist anywhere else in the universe? And how did it get started? Scientists are seeking the answers in the cosmos, our solar system and right here on planet Earth. 

Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2Vj

Is there life elsewhere in the universe? Anyone who has pondered the immensity of the cosmos has probably wondered at some time or another whether life exists beyond our planet? 

The search for life beyond Earth has been buoyed by recent discoveries made by NASA's Kepler telescope - it's looking for planets outside our solar system known as exoplanets. Kepler measures the brightness of distant stars and tracks a stars dimming when a planet passes in front. Up until 1995, exoplanets were purely theoretical - but scientists have since identified thousands of them.

in July, NASA scientists announced the discovery of one of their most exciting exoplanets yet - Kepler-452B. Located some fourteen thousand light-years away the planet is in the habitable zone which means it's the right distance from its own Sun and also the right size to potentially be earth-like. 

There is a limit to how much we can learn about Kepler-452B because of its distance. NASA is launching the James Webb telescope in 2018 to find earth-like planets closer to home so they can study their atmospheres for bio signatures that would indicate the presence of life. But there's another way to learn more about distant planets beyond what the Kepler telescope can tell us, and that is to look for signs of intelligent life. 

Frank Drake has been listening out for signals of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe for over 50 years. Mr Drake came up with something called the Drake Equation which is a mathematical formula that estimates how many advanced civilizations capable of transmitting signals might exist in the universe. He co-founded the SETI Institute, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Scientists at the SETI Institute have been searching for intelligent life for the past few decades.

SETI researchers have not come across any signals yet but they say this is to be expected. SETI's efforts recently got a huge boost with a launch of breakthrough Listen, overseen by Martin Rees, Stephen Hawking, and Frank Drake and funded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Yuri Milner. The project will greatly expand the organization's capacity to search and sift through data. But scientists aren't only interested in discovering life forms light-years away. At first glance our solar system seems like a rather unlikely place to find life beyond Earth but the reason scientists think it is plausible is because of the discovery of a group of organisms called extremophiles that live on earth.

Scientists are looking at the moons of Jupiter and Saturn as well as our nearest neighbor Mars. The hope is that if we find further life in our solar system on places like Mars, we will improve our understanding of how easily it might have started elsewhere. But there is another way to answer this question - determining how it started on earth.
 
One man who is trying to come up with an answer to this question is Jack Szostak. In his lab at Harvard University he's trying to determine how easy it is to create life by making it himself.   Modern cells are intricate nano scale factories stuffed with thousands of different chemicals each taking part in a complicated and messy web of reactions. Long strands of DNA and codicils genetic information. Shorter strands of RNA carry that information around the cell telling it how to manufacture the proteins that run the chemical reactions it requires to live. It seems unlikely that these systems all evolved at the same time. At the Szostak lab they're focused on two experiments. One to work out how primitive cell membranes could grow and divide into daughter cells, and the other on RNA replication. 

Dr Szostak and his team have already created a protocell from a blob of lipids which contains RNA. The sticking point at the moment is working out how to make RNA that can copy itself without relying on a helping hand from RNA enzymes. If it is a difficult process reliant upon various bits of luck or circumstance then it is possible that we are a cosmic fluke - one that isn't going to be repeated elsewhere. But if experiments like Dr Szostak show that life emerges easily, then the odds of life appearing elsewhere in the universe look more likely. 

Perhaps one day when we're looking into the night sky we'll finally know the answer to the question are we alone?

moonlanding,"A New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site by NASA Goddard 4 years ago 73 seconds 119,323 views","Apollo 11 landed on the Moon on July 20th, 1969, a little after 4:00 in the afternoon Eastern Daylight Time. The Lunar Module, nicknamed Eagle and flown by Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, touched down near the southern rim of the Sea of Tranquility, one of the large, dark basins that contribute to the Man in the Moon visible from Earth. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two hours outside the LM setting up experiments and collecting samples. At one point, Armstrong ventured east of the LM to examine a small crater, dubbed Little West, that he'd flown over just before landing.

The trails of disturbed regolith created by the astronauts' boots are still clearly visible in photographs of the landing site taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) narrow-angle camera (LROC) more than four decades later.

LROC imagery makes it possible to visit the landing site in a whole new way by flying around a three-dimensional model of the site. LROC scientists created the digital elevation model using a stereo pair of images. Each image in the pair shows the site from a slightly different angle, allowing sophisticated software to infer the shape of the terrain, similar to the way that left and right eye views are combined in the brain to produce the perception of depth.

The animator draped an LROC photograph over the terrain model. He also added a 3D model of the LM descent stage—the real LM in the photograph looks oddly flat when viewed at an oblique angle.

Although the area around the site is relatively flat by lunar standards, West Crater (the big brother of the crater visited by Armstrong) appears in dramatic relief near the eastern edge of the terrain model. Ejecta from West comprises the boulders that Armstrong had to avoid as he searched for a safe landing site.

Apollo 11 was the first of six increasingly ambitious crewed lunar landings. The exploration of the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts, when combined with the wealth of remote sensing data now being returned by LRO, continues to inform our understanding of our nearest neighbor in space.

The Mars rover, Curiosity, is the latest in a long line of missions to Mars: landers sent to scoop its soil and study its rocks, orbiters sent to map its valleys and ridges.

They are all asking the same question. Did liquid water once flow on this dry and dusty world? Did it support life in any form? And are there remnants left to find? The science that comes out of these missions may help answer a much larger, more philosophical question.

Is our planet Earth the norm, in a galaxy run through with life-bearing planets? Or is Earth a rare gem, with a unique make-up and history that allowed it to give rise to living things? On Mars, Curiosity has spotted pebbles and other rocks commonly associated with flowing water. 

It found them down stream on what appears to be an ancient river fan, where water flowed down into Gale Crater. This shows that at some point in the past, Mars had an atmosphere, cloudy skies, and liquid water flowing. So what could have turned it into the desolate world we know today? 

One process that very likely played a role goes by the unscientific name, ""sputtering."" Like the other planets in our solar system, Mars is lashed by high-energy photons from the Sun. When one of these photons enters the atmosphere of a planet, it can crash into a molecule, knocking loose an electron and turning it into an ion. The solar wind brings something else: a giant magnetic field. When part of the field grazes the planet, it can attract ions and launch them out into space. 

Another part might fling ions right into the atmosphere at up to a thousand kilometers per second. The ions crash into other molecules, sending them in all directions like balls in a game of pool. Over billions of years, this process could have literally stripped Mars of its atmosphere, especially in the early life of the solar system when the solar wind was more intense than it is today. 

Sputtering has actually been spotted directly on another dead planet, Venus. The Venus Express mission found that solar winds are steadily stripping off lighter molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet on the night side... then ride solar breezes on out into space.

This process has left Venus with an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide gas... a heat trapping compound that has helped send surface temperatures up to around 400 degrees Celsius. The loss of Venus' atmosphere likely took place over millions of years, especially during solar outbursts known as coronal mass ejections. 

If these massive blast waves stripped Venus and Mars of an atmosphere capable of supporting life how did Earth avoid the same grim fate?  We can see the answer as the solar storm approaches earth. Our planet has what Mars and Venus lack - a powerful magnetic field generated deep within its core.
 
This protective shield deflects many of the high-energy particles launched by the Sun. In fact, that's just our first line of defense. Much of the solar energy that gets through is reflected back to space by clouds, ice, and snow. 

The energy that earth absorbs is just enough to power a remarkable planetary engine: the climate. It's set in motion by the uneveness of solar heating, due in part to the cycles of day and night, and the seasons. That causes warm, tropical winds to blow toward the poles, and cold polar air toward the equator.  

Wind currents drive surface ocean currents. This computer simulation shows the Gulf Stream winding its way along the coast of North America. This great ocean river carries enough heat energy to power the industrial world a hundred times over.
 
It breaks down in massive whirlpools that spread warm tropical waters over northern seas. Below the surface, they mix with cold deep currents that swirl around undersea ledges and mountains. Earth's climate engine has countless moving parts: tides and terrain, cross winds and currents -- all working to equalize temperatures around the globe.

Over time, earth developed a carbon cycle and an effective means of regulating green house gases. In our galaxy, are still-born worlds like Mars the norm? Or in Earth, has Nature crafted a prototype for its greatest experiment... Life?","Why Mars Died, and Earth Lived",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC31pqk9sak,5,,0,572,5471114,39072,2095,0,10737,5523018

The International Space Station is a near zero-gravity laboratory dedicated to scientific research. The end of NASA's shuttle program in 2011 left the world with only one way to get there, buy a seat from the Russians. NASA is holding a competition challenging private enterprise to build America's next spacecraft. Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada are all multi-billion dollar aerospace companies competing to win the NASA contract that could cement dominance in the emerging space industry. Bloomberg gets rare access to these space pioneers, including a tour of SpaceX with CEO Elon Musk. (Source: Bloomberg)

The game of Basketball has been my passion since I was 5 years old. I grew up as a kid watching my dad's recorded VHS tapes of playoff games through the 70s and 80s, and collected all the Basketball cards. Something about the game and what it represents just hooked me from a very young age.
My love for the game only continues to grow as time goes on. I love studying and analyzing the game, with an unbiased perspective. Feel free to subscribe, follow me on social media, and celebrate this amazing game and it's rich history with me!

moonlanding,"Apollo 11 Command Module | 3D Documentation by Smithsonian's Digitization Program Office 2 years ago 3 minutes, 59 seconds 165,995 views","3-D model: http://3d.si.edu/apollo11cm/index.php
Smithsonian Releases High-Resolution 3-D Model of Apollo 11 
Command Module To Explore and Print
To mark the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon-landing mission, the Smithsonian has made available a high-resolution 3-D scan of the command module “Columbia,” the spacecraft that carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. This highly detailed model, available at 3d.si.edu, allows anyone with an internet connection to explore the entire craft including its intricate interior, which is not possible when viewing the artifact in the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. The Smithsonian is also making the data file of the model available for download so it can be 3-D printed or viewed with virtual-reality goggles. 

The 3-D scanning process for the command module was extremely challenging. The module is composed of reflective surfaces that 3-D capture devices do not read well. Its interior dashboards are made up of many components that are delicate and intricate, which also presents a challenge for many 3-D capture devices. Because of the complicated nature of this scan, the Smithsonian 3-D team worked with its technology partner, Autodesk Inc., a leader in cloud-based 3-D design and engineering software. 

Autodesk developed custom 3-D scanning equipment for the project, invented algorithms for integrating multi-sensor scan data, developed software for processing the massive data set and generated a master 3-D model of the command module.  As one of the most sophisticated scans ever made of a historic artifact, it employed seven different scanning technologies to capture nearly 1 trillion high-resolution measurements producing more than a terabyte of compressed data resulting in a highly detailed master model. Autodesk also produced animations, virtual-reality panoramas, and a unique in-browser viewing platform so Smithsonian curators can publish interpretive and interactive 3-D experiences of the command module for the public.
The scanning enabled the curatorial and collections team to get glimpses of the interior of the command module they had not seen. Protective covering over the hatch opening of the Command Module has only been removed a handful of times since the artifact came into the collection in 1971. 

During the scanning, curators rediscovered a number of instances of “astronaut graffiti” not previously known to the museum. Some of the markings include numbers and information relayed from mission control written on walls or instrument panels. There also is a hand-drawn calendar by one of the astronauts, with each day crossed out except for landing day. Seeing such details and studying the text have enhanced curators’ understanding of how the missions were conducted. Now details like these markings are available in the 3-D model. The 3-D model will also be featured in the upcoming exhibition “Destination Moon,” slated for opening at the National Air and Space Museum in 2020. 

The museum is commemorating the anniversary of the moon landing by displaying Armstrong’s Apollo 11 Lunar Exploration gloves and helmet at the Steven F. Udvar Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va. They will be on view for one year, starting July 20. The Smithsonian launched its 3-D scanning and imaging program in 2013 to make museum collections and scientific specimens more widely available for use and study. 
The Smithsonian 3-D Collection features objects from the Smithsonian that highlight different applications of 3-D capture and printing, as well as digital delivery methods for 3-D data in research, education and conservation. Objects include the Wright Flyer, a model of the remnants of supernova Cassiopeia A, a fossil whale and a sixth-century Buddha statue. The public can explore all these objects online at 3d.si.edu, a free custom-built, plug-in-free browser and download the data for their own use in modeling programs or to print using a 3-D printer.",Apollo 11 Command Module | 3D Documentation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyiy2fiV_Mc,-1,,-1,239,166611,894,25,0,263,167793

Teams in Oxford, U.K., and Boston, U.S., are working on new designs for plane engines, with the potential to create a ""very high-speed aircraft"" and take fuel out of the equation altogether. CNBC takes a look at both options.

Scimitar is a prototype jet engine from UK-based Reaction Engines. Developers tell CNBC that the experimental apparatus can extend the speed, the power, and the range of existing systems by up to 5 times the speed of sound.

Researchers from MIT are working on developing technology they hope will completely rethink aviation propulsion altogether, using an ion thruster. CNBC takes a closer look.

Most fish die the same way — slow suffocation in the open air. It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid. Those chemicals make the fish taste bad, smell “fishy,” and rot quickly. 

But there's a better way: a four-step Japanese method called ikejime. It involves sharp knives. And a brain spike. 

We adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare

The lunar landing site was the Taurus-Littrow highlands and valley area. This site was picked for Apollo 17 as a location where rocks both older and younger than those previously returned from other Apollo missions, as well as from Luna 16 and 20 missions, might be found.

The mission was the final in a series of three J-type missions planned for the Apollo Program. These J-type missions can be distinguished from previous G- and H-series missions by extended hardware capability, larger scientific payload capacity and by the use of the battery-powered Lunar Roving Vehicle, or LRV.

Scientific objectives of the Apollo 17 mission included, geological surveying and sampling of materials and surface features in a preselected area of the Taurus-Littrow region; deploying and activating surface experiments; and conducting in-flight experiments and photographic tasks during lunar orbit and transearth coast. These objectives included deployed experiments, such as the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, or ALSEP, with a heat flow experiment; lunar seismic profiling, or LSP; lunar surface gravimeter, or LSG; lunar atmospheric composition experiment, or LACE; and lunar ejecta and meteorites, or LEAM. The mission also included lunar sampling and lunar orbital experiments. Biomedical experiments included the Biostack II experiment and the BIOCORE experiment.

Mission Highlights

At 9:15:29 a.m. GMT Dec. 7, 1972, the command and service module, or CSM, was separated from the S-IVB. Approximately 15 min later, the CSM docked with the lunar module, or LM. After CSM/LM extraction from the S-IVB, the S-IVB was targeted for lunar impact, which occurred Dec. 10, at 8:32:43 p.m. The impact location was approximately 84 nautical miles northwest of the planned target point and the event was recorded by the passive seismic experiments deployed on the Apollos 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions.

Only one of the four planned midcourse corrections was required during translunar coast. A midcourse correction made at 5:03 p.m. Dec. 8, was a 1.6 second service propulsion system burn resulting in a 10 :5 feet second velocity change. Lunar orbit insertion was accomplished at 7:47:23 p.m. Dec. 10, placing the spacecraft into a lunar orbit of 170 by 52.6 nautical miles. Approximately four hours, 20 minutes later, the orbit was reduced to 59 by 15 nautical miles. The spacecraft remained in this low orbit for more than 18 hours, during which time the CSM LM undocking and separation were performed. The CSM circularization maneuver was performed at 6:50:29 p.m. Dec. 11, which placed the CSM into an orbit of 70.3 by 54.3 nautical miles. At 2:35 p.m. Dec. 11, the commander and lunar module pilot entered the LM to prepare for descent to the lunar surface. At 6:55:42 p.m. Dec. 11, the LM was placed into an orbit with a perilune altitude of 6.2 nautical miles. Approximately 47 minutes later, the powered descent to the lunar surface began. Landing occurred at 7:54:57 p.m. Dec. 11, at lunar latitude 20 degrees, 10 minutes north, and longitude 30 degrees 46 minutes east. Apollo 17 was the last lunar landing mission. Three extravehicular activities, or EVAs, lasted a total of 22 hours, four minutes on the lunar surface. EVA No. 1 began at 11:54:49 p.m. Dec. 11, with Eugene Cernan egressing at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 12. The first EVA was seven hours, 12 minutes long and was completed at 7:06:42 a.m. Dec. 12. The second EVA began at 11:28:06 p.m. Dec. 12, and lasted seven hours, 37 minutes, ending at at 7:05:02 a.m. Dec. 13. The final EVA began at 10:25:48 p.m. Dec. 13, and ended at 5:40:56 a.m. Dec. 14.

The Buran Story by Mustard 1 year ago 10 minutes 1,382,310 views","On November 15, 1988, the world learned that the Soviet Union also had their own space shuttle. It had been secretly under development for well over a decade and it had cost the Soviets billions to build it. Several of the spacecraft were in various stages of construction. But the Soviet shuttle, named the Buran, would only ever launch once. Its development had largely been driven by the need to respond to the perceived military potential of the NASA Space Shuttle.

When the Buran was first launched, the world speculated that it would be used to build Soviet space stations or even assemble spacecraft for a manned mars mission. But as the Soviet Union began to collapse, funding for the Buran program was limited and eventually eliminated.

There’s no denying that the Buran looks very similar to the Space Shuttle. But in many ways, the Buran was quite different from the NASA Space Shuttle. The Buran orbiter didn’t have integrated main engines. Almost all of its lifting power was provided by a separate super-heavy rocket called Energia, which consisted of a core stage and 4 liquid-fueled boosters. Unlike the Space shuttle, which was a single system, the Buran orbiter, and its lifting rockets were actually two separate systems.
 
While the Shuttle, with its integrated engines, was more reusable, in practice, it required intensive maintenance between launches, which offset a lot of this advantage.  But once in space, the Space Shuttle’s integrated engines no longer served a purpose. So, for most of the Shuttle’s mission, it was forced to haul around thousands of pounds of dead weight. Without integrated engines, the Buran could carry slightly more payload than the American Space Shuttle. But the Energia rocket could launch by itself, without the Buran attached. That meant it could carry external payloads into space, and could launch an astounding 100 tons. From the outset, the Buran was also capable of fully automated flight, meaning it could be launched, put into orbit and returned back to earth without any crew on board. 

In the final days of the Soviet Union, when it was clear that the American shuttle had no meaningful military potential, the Soviet military no longer wanted anything to do with the Buran. The Soviet space community was left with a spacecraft that was expensive, complex, and largely without a real purpose. #Buran #SpaceRace #Spaceships  #SovietSpaceProgram

Further Research:

We highly recommend the book ‘Energiya-Buran: The Soviet Space Shuttle’ by Bart Hendrickx and Bert Vis. The book was an extremely useful resource in researching this video. You will not find a more detailed or comprehensive look on the Buran program, covering everything from the program’s conception to its legacy:

moonlanding,"Cosmic Journeys - Mars: Earth that Never Was by SpaceRip 8 years ago 25 minutes 1,615,337 views","Did Mars long ago develop far enough for life to arise? If so, does anything still live within Mars' dusty plains, beneath its ice caps, or somewhere underground? 

In 1964 the Mariner Four spacecraft flew by Mars and got a good look. What it saw looked more like the Moon than the Earth. Then, in the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter robot teams, named Viking, went in for an even closer look. The landers tested the soil for the chemical residues of life. All the evidence from Viking told us: Mars is dead. And extremely harsh.

The mission recorded Martian surface temperatures from -17 degrees Celsius down to -107. We now know it can get even colder than that at the poles. The atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, with only traces of oxygen. And it's extremely thin, with less than one percent the surface pressure of Earth's atmosphere.

And it's bone dry. In fact, the Sahara Desert is a rainforest compared to Mars, where water vapor is a trace gas in the atmosphere. On Earth, impact craters erode over time from wind and water... and even volcanic activity. On Mars, they can linger for billions of years. 

Earth's surface is shaped and reshaped by the horizontal movement of plates that make up its crust driven by heat welling up from the planet's hot interior. At half the width and only 11% the mass of Earth, Mars doesn't generate enough heat to support wide-scale plate tectonics. 

Nor does it have the gravity to hold a thick atmosphere needed to store enough heat at the surface to allow liquid water to flow. Nonetheless, some areas that looked to Viking-era scientists like craters and volcanic areas, were later shown to be riverbeds, lake bottoms, and ocean shorelines. 

If water once flowed on Mars' surface, where did it all go?

This was the scene at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in 2004. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity had just bounced down on the Red Planet. When the excitement died down, the rovers were set off on one of the most remarkable journeys in the history of planetary exploration. Missions like this could one day pave the way for a day when we'll view images from a real astronaut's camera.

Opportunity had come to rest in a small crater near the equator, at a spot called Meridiani Planum. Here, in plain view, on a nearby crater wall, its camera revealed exposed bedrock, the first ever seen on Mars. Not far away, the rover found layered rocks on the face of a cliff. On Earth, they typically form as sedimentary layers at the bottom of oceans. 

And at every turn, Opportunity rolled across tiny, smooth, round pellets. They became known as ""blueberries"" because they appeared purplish-brown against Mars' rust-colored surface.  Initially thought to be volcanic in origin, they turned out to be iron-rich spherules of the type that form within cavities in the mud at the bottom of an ocean. 

Drilling into rocks, the rover inserted a spectrometer to read the mineral content. The readings showed significant amounts of sulfate salt, a tracer for standing water. That wasn't all. Spirit's broken wheel, dragging behind it, exposed soils saturated in salt. 

Clearly there once was water on Mars' surface, but how long ago?  And, if there is anything left, where would you find it? One possible answer: the North Pole.  From orbit, this region seemed to be covered in frozen CO2 - what we call dry ice. But was there water ice below the surface?

Enter Phoenix, a lander that touched down near the North Pole in early 2008. Radar readings from orbit, taken by the Mars Express mission, hinted at the presence of ice just below the surface.

The Phoenix lander's descent thrusters blew away the top layer of soil, allowing its camera to snap pictures of what looked like ice. Scientists instructed the robot to conduct a simple experiment: reach out and dig a trench, then watch what happens.

As expected, clumps of white stuff appeared. A couple of days later, it was gone. Vaporized. That means it can't be salt or frozen CO2, which is stable in the cold dry temperatures of the Martian pole. So it had to be water, the first ever directly seen on Mars.

There are indications that the North Pole was actually warm enough in the recent past for water ice to become liquid. The Mars Reconaissance Orbiter, or MRO, used radar pulses to peer beneath the surface of the ice cap. These data reveal that the ice, just over a mile thick, formed in a succession of layers as the climate alternated between warm and cold. 

Our planet avoids mood swings like this in part because its spin is stabilized by a massive moon. Mars' spin is not, so it can really wobble, with the pole tilting toward the sun for long periods. New observations by the MRO spacecraft show that these wobbles can lead to dramatic releases of CO2, and warming periods due to an increase in the greenhouse effect.",Cosmic Journeys - Mars: Earth that Never Was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgMXPXdqJn8,5,,0,1518,1649191,8117,398,0,1801,1659507

-The day of the launch, the Astronauts (and a few support people) were the only ones with 3 miles of the launch site.
-There were 13 successful launches of the Saturn V rocket.

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Has planet earth ever had a close encounter with aliens?

While UFOs and their occupants have been part of our culture for more than a century, and people from many walks of life claim to have seen them, we have no indisputable evidence that they’re fact rather than fiction, or do we?  Naked Science speaks to witnesses of two of the most controversial UFO sightings, the Rendlesham Forest incident in the UK and the Phoenix Lights sighting in the US, as well as the most famous UFO incident of all time, Roswell.

If unidentified flying objects did come from space, how could they have travelled to earth?  And how could they survive in our atmosphere?  We talk to leading physicists and astrophysicists about the viability of interstellar travel and whether worm holes and warp drives could make it possible.  Or perhaps extra-terrestrials will send tiny self-replicating nanobots to explore our Earth?

Close encounters originated with reported sightings of alien craft, but in the last few decades alien contact has taken a new and more terrifying twist, alien abduction.  We talk to a so called ‘experiencer’ who claims to have been taken from her bed and experimented on.  She believes her claims but could there be another, scientific, explanation for what she remembers?  We talk to a neuroscientist who thinks he has the answer.

Finally, Naked Science asks possibly the most shocking question of all, could aliens already be among us?",Naked Science - Close Encounters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2JhlBi525w,5,,0,3001,2286594,7231,1522,0,3037,2298384
moonlanding,"Why can't we see the Apollo lunar landers on the Moon from Earth ? by Curious Droid 2 years ago 6 minutes, 32 seconds 2,230,942 views","When you look up at a full moon, just remember that somewhere on the lunar face, the remains of Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 along with 8 unmanned Russian Luna missions and 5 pre-Apollo unmanned American Surveyor missions are all still there….. silently looking back….. unless of course, you’re a NASA non-believer.

so… why can’t we see these from the earth, why can’t we train our best telescopes on to the moon’s surface and see them there exactly where we left them the best part of 50 years ago.
Well, there a bit of a problem…. and that is that the moon is 384,000 kilometres or 238,000 miles away and the landers and all the other things left behind are just few meters across. 
To give you an Idea how difficult a problems that it is….. it’s like  looking for an object the size of a coin from 1000 miles away or the equivalent from New York to  Florida…. so you going to need a pretty serious telescope.

One telescope that springs to mind is the Hubble space telescope, after all if it can see galaxy’s billons of light years away then it should be able to see the Apollo landers easily…. shouldn’t it ??
Well, as with many things to do with space it’s not that simple.  Yes, the Hubble space telescope was indeed designed to look at very faint objects at astronomical distances but those objects are clusters of galaxy’s trillions of millions across, it was not designed the take high resolution images of small objects at fairly close ranges in astronomical terms like to the moon.
The problem is down to the resolution of the images that the telescope can produce and that is limited by the laws of physics. The resolution determines the size the smallest Picture Element is or pixel in the image. The higher the resolution more of the fine detail in an image can be seen. 
In a telescope, the bigger the mirror, the more the magnification, so the closer the object will appear but at the very large magnifications the image is also affected by the wavelength of the light itself. The shorter the wavelength like ultraviolet light, the finer the detail that can be captured and the resolution increases but in visible light as we go from blue through green to red,  the wavelength increases and the resolution is decreased. 
The Hubble has a mirror which is 2.4 meters in diameter, that was the largest that could fit in to the Space Shuttle when it was placed in to orbit. This gives it a single pixel resolution in ultra violet light of about 43 meters across on the moon’s surface, anything smaller than 43 meters across will just be hidden in a single dot which cannot be resolved any further, in fact we need really 2 pixels or more to make out anything at all......

moonlanding,"Venus: Death of a Planet by SpaceRip 6 years ago 25 minutes 2,921,925 views","Why did Earth thrive and our sister planet, Venus, died? From the fires of a sun's birth... twin planets emerged. Then their paths diverged. Nature draped one world in the greens and blues of life. While enveloping the other in acid clouds...  high heat... and volcanic flows. Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?

For as long as we have gazed upon the stars, they have offered few signs... that somewhere out there... are worlds as rich and diverse as our own. Recently, though, astronomers have found ways to see into the bright lights of nearby stars. 

They've been discovering planets at a rapid clip... using observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope... A French observatory known as Corot ... .And an array of ground-based instruments. The count is approaching 500... and rising. These alien worlds run the gamut...  from great gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter... to rocky, charred remnants that burned when their parent star exploded. 

Some have wild elliptical orbits... swinging far out into space... then diving into scorching stellar winds. Still others orbit so close to their parent stars that their surfaces are likely bathed in molten rock. Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing hints of water or ice... ingredients needed to nurture life as we know it. The race to find other Earths has raised anew the ancient question... whether, out in the folds of our galaxy, planets like our own are abundant... and life commonplace? Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden in a barren universe?

With so little direct evidence of these other worlds to go on, we have only the stories of planets within our own solar system to gauge the chances of finding another Earth.   Consider, for example, a world that has long had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet. Except for the moon, there's no brighter light in our night skies than the planet Venus... known as both the morning and the evening star.

The ancient Romans named it for their goddess of beauty and love. In time, the master painters transformed this classical symbol into an erotic figure.  It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified planet Venus... charting its phases as it moved around the sun, drawing it into the ranks of the other planets. 

With a similar size and weight, Venus became known as Earth's sister planet. But how Earth-like is it? The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin luminescence on its edge. 

Venus, he found, has an atmosphere. Later observations revealed a thick layer of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were made of water vapor, like those on Earth. Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below? And did anyone, or anything, live there? 

NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962... in the first-ever close planetary encounter. Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing at all like Earth. Rather, it's extremely hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide.

The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly... only once every 243 Earth days... and it goes in the opposite direction. American and Soviet scientists found out just how strange Venus is when they sent a series of landers down to take direct readings.

Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea level on Earth. The air is so thick that it's not a gas, but a ""supercritical fluid."" Liquid CO2. On our planet, the only naturally occurring source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure environments of undersea volcanoes. It comes in handy for extracting caffeine from coffee beans... or drycleaning our clothes.

You just wouldn't want to have to breathe it. The Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock, with no water in sight. In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere would be just 3 centimeters deep. Compare that to Earth... where the oceans would form a layer 3 kilometers deep.

If you could land on Venus, you'd be treated to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted in orange hues. The winds are light, only a few miles per hour... but the air is so thick that a breeze would knock you over. Look up and you'd see fast-moving clouds... streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the surface.

The clouds are so dense and reflective that Venus absorbs much less solar energy than Earth, even though it's 30% closer to the Sun.",Venus: Death of a Planet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR-IWhZZDJY,5,,0,1506,2933847,13371,1066,0,3306,2951590

Since the early 1970s conspiracy theorists have created ever more elaborate stories about how NASA faked the moon landings, much to the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands of people who worked in some capacity to make these missions a reality, and even more so to the men who were brave enough to sit in front of a massive controlled explosion, take a little jaunt through the soul crushing void of space in an extremely complex ship built by the lowest bidder, then get into another spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been test fired before they lit the candle, and all with the goal of exiting said ship with only a special suit between them and oblivion.

Apollo 13 is a 1995 American docudrama space adventure film directed by Ron Howard. The film stars Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris. The screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., and Al Reinert, that dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission, is an adaptation of the book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.
The film depicts astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.",History Buffs: Apollo 13,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjCOMJDULaE,-1,,-1,3150,1788288,38876,898,0,7374,1835436

Although the USA won the race to the moon, if you’d been a betting person from the mid 1950’s to 1960’s, the chances are that you would have thought the Soviet Union had a very good chance of getting there first.

So why didn’t Russia put a man on the moon?

At the time the soviets were leading the space race, they had already started with the launch of Sputnik, then launched several probes to the moon, including one in 1959 that orbited and taken photos of the far side and By 1961 they were the first to put a man in to space.

So when Kennedy made his now famous “We choose to go to the moon” speech in 1962 to rally public support, Khrushchev’s response was silence, neither confirming nor denying that they had a plan for a manned moon mission.

But at the time Khrushchev wasn’t really interested in competing with the US over the moon, he was more interested ICBM’s the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles for the strategic rocket forces.
But there were others that had harboured plans for manned mission for a long time, these included the man whose name was a state secret and the most powerful man outside the Kremlin when it came to space.

He was Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, outside the inner circle of the top space scientists he was known only as the “Chief Designer” or by his first 2 initials SP, because the Soviet leadership feared that the western powers would send agents to assassinate him........

moonlanding,"The Incredible Journey of Apollo 12 by SpaceRip 7 years ago 24 minutes 2,087,197 views","It's the ultimate buddy movie, with two astronauts hitting the road and landing on the moon. Earth. November 14, 1969. Three astronauts, with spacesuits, food, water, and a battery of scientific and communications equipment, prepared to fly to the moon. Thousands gathered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, including President and Mrs. Richard Nixon, to witness the historic launch. It was raining that day, but that was no cause for delay. The ship that would carry them into space was designed to launch in any weather.  

But how would it respond to a powerful electrical storm now gathering above the launch pad? That was just the beginning of the incredible journey of Apollo 12. 

With three astronauts fastened into their seats, the countdown proceeded. Astronaut and Mission Commander Pete Conrad would say later: ""The flight was extremely normal, for the first 36 seconds."" The five engines of the Saturn 5's huge first stage were designed to burn through 5 million pounds of liquid oxygen in just two and a half minutes, and to send the spacecraft up 67 kilometers above the Atlantic Ocean. 

When it reached an altitude of 2000 meters, something unexpected happened. Racing through the stormy environment, the rocket generated a lightning bolt that traveled down its highly conductive exhaust trail. 

Another bolt hit 16 seconds later. All of the spacecraft's circuit breakers shut off. The tracking system was lost. A young flight controller in Houston, Texas instructed astronaut Alan Bean on how to turn on an auxiliary power system. The mission was back on track. Once in Earth orbit, all systems appeared to check out, and flight control officials gave the crew the green light to leave Earth.

The astronauts were not told of concern that the lighting strikes had damaged the pyrotechnic system used to deploy the parachutes that would ease them back through the Earth's atmosphere. If that system failed, the astronauts would not return alive.

This mission would have its share of perils, not unlike those faced by a long line of past explorers, whose courage and restless spirit propelled them into the unknown. This one, however, was backed by years of technology development, test flights, astronaut training, and the largest support team back home that any mission ever had.

But hundreds of thousands of kilometers out in space the three astronauts were pretty much on their own. What made Apollo 12 unique was the friendship and chemistry of its crew. Conrad, Bean, and Richard Gordon were all Navy men. Working and training together on the Gemini program, they had gained each other's respect and trust. 

Now, hurtling across more than 400,000 kilometers to the moon, they prepared to fullfill the mission's goals. One was to set up a scientific station designed to record seismic, atmospheric, and solar data. 

Another was to visit an unmanned lunar probe called Surveyor III that had landed there two and a half years before. The idea was to bring back a part to study the effect of the lunar environment. 

A third goal was to improve on the landing of Apollo 11 just 5 months before. Dropping down over a region called the Sea of Tranquility, pilot Neil Armstrong found himself heading straight for a crater full of boulders. He had to fly over the planned landing site and find a new one. Now kilometers beyond the target, the lander, called Eagle, was literally running out of gas.

With less than 30 seconds of fuel left, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin finally touched down on a landscape obscured by dust stirred up by the vehicle's thrusters.  Future astronauts would have to be able to make precision landings at locations dictated by science. That meant they would have to touch down on landscapes filled with all kinds of rocks and craters.

For Apollo 12, the science pointed to a region known as the Ocean of Storms, some 2000 kilometers from where the Eagle had landed. Here, the landscape is dark from lava that cooled to form its flat expanse billions of years ago.",The Incredible Journey of Apollo 12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBhIDjWaByg,-1,,-1,1471,2117603,9480,1211,0,5174,2133468
moonlanding,"Why have SpaceX, Boeing & Blue Origin ditched abort towers? by Everyday Astronaut 2 months ago 19 minutes 792,644 views","Want an article version of this video? Here you go! https://everydayastronaut.com/abort-towers/

There’s a new trend going around in the commercial space industry when it comes to launch abort systems. All three commercial companies who are putting abort systems on their crewed vehicles have ditched the classic launch abort tower we’ve seen dominate abort systems in the past.

Previous vehicles like the Mercury capsule, the Apollo capsule and even the Soyuz all used an escape tower that sat on top of the crew module, capable of pulling the vehicle away from a failing rocket in a hurry.

And to make this topic even more interesting, we’re seeing another trend in abort systems... SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s Starliner capsules both are using liquid fueled abort motors instead of solid rocket motors.

So today we’re going to talk about the design considerations that have made SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin ditch abort towers on their crewed vehicles and we’re also going to evaluate why the heck Boeing and SpaceX are going with liquid motors instead of solid motors. 

And with both Boeing and SpaceX having experienced serious setbacks and complications with their liquid fueled abort systems, including the loss of a test vehicle, it raises the question… is it even a good idea?....

Yes, we landed on the moon, but it’s been almost 45 years since we’ve been back there. Heck, it’s been almost 45 years since we went beyond low Earth orbit. 
 
And when I say “we,” I mean the United States. Only 12 humans have ever walked on the surface of the moon, all of them men, and all of them American. The last two to be there were Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. That was in December of 1972, of the Apollo 17 mission.

It’s easy to understand why people would be skeptical. Skeptics often point to the motive for wanting to fake the whole thing. The race to the moon was part of the Space Race, during a particularly tense time during the Cold War. The United States and Soviet Union were battling it out to get there first. Skeptics say the United States would have wanted to fake it to show they won the Space Race even if they knew it actually wasn’t possible to go. The Soviet Union had epically failed to ever get even near the moon, so they argue it seems suspicious that the United States able to land men safely on the moon six times in 3 and a half years, yet never do so since. Was this just a publicity stunt, faked in order to strongly discourage the Soviet Union and give the United States a huge advantage in the Cold War while saving its lots of money? 
 
But how could this hoax be pulled off? Skeptics argue the technology did exist to recreate a fake mooning landing in a film studio. Sure, they argue the astronauts really did take off into space, but they likely just orbited the earth for several days before landing back on Earth, while faked footage was distributed to the masses.
But what evidence do that have of the moon landings being faked? For the rest of this video, I will first give you evidence that creates doubt, then give you NASA’s response, and then give you my conclusion.
 
The first thing that causes doubt is the footage showing the American flag on the moon waving. Skeptics say the flag waving shows the presence of wind, which should be impossible on the moon because it doesn’t have much of an atmosphere and is surrounded by a vacuum. NASA insists that the flag moved due to astronaut Buzz Aldrin twisting the flagpole, causing it to move like that. Apparently the astronauts also accidentally bent the horizontal rods that were supposed to hold the flag outward.
The next evidence that causes doubt is the fact that there were no stars in any of the footage or photographs taken by NASA on the moon. Skeptics say stars were left out because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or Moon. NASA, as well as many many others, argue that of course you wouldn’t be able to see the stars because the moon’s surface is so bright. It’s the same reason why you can’t see the stars standing on a bright football field at night. Some astronauts were able to take long exposure UV photographs of bright stars and Venus from the moon, though. But skeptics would probably argue these photos were taken from earth.
What about the fact that there was no blast crater from the lunar module on the moon, especially when scientists before predicted one would be created? Well NASA says those scientists predicted wrong. The fact is, the pressure on the moon was simply too low for the lunar module to create a crater.
Quite a bit of discussion by skeptics revolve around the discussion of lighting and shadows in photographs taken on the moon. Shadows are inconsistent and often intersect in photographs. Skeptics argue that the shadows should be completely black and run parallel to each other. NASA and others argue that shadows are weird on the Moon due to many light sources and lunar dust. Also, the unique terrain of the moon alters how the shadows are seen.
Skeptics also say the photographs on the Moon show the same exact background, despite astronauts saying the photos were taken far away from each other. They argue that the backdrop was basically kept the same, even for different Apollo missions. Take this photograph, for example. Skeptics have combined the two pictures and claim the backgrounds match. Pretty crazy, eh? Well, NASA says that because the Moon is much smaller than Earth, horizons appear closer to the naked eye than they really are, and thus may look identical from different viewpoints.",Did We Really Land on the Moon?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_bVQitVmjU,-1,,-1,610,26428,393,86,0,386,27293

moonlanding,"10 MIND BLOWING Secrets In US Dollars! by Secret Truths 1 year ago 12 minutes 1,386,890 views","Crazy facts about the money of the United States!


 #8. “Hidden Critters”-This curious aspect of the one-dollar bill isn’t as easy to debunk as some of theories revolving around US currency. If you look extremely closely, and we mean magnifying glass close, outside of the top left part of the ornate border that surrounds the number one on the right side of the bill you will see an odd looking figure. Some say that the image is of a skull and some say it is a spider but the most common thing that people think it is, is an owl. What is the significance of this hidden critter? Well as it turns out the owl is considered to be one of the main symbols of the Freemasons, the secret and powerful brotherhood that many of the founding fathers are believed to have belonged. The Freemasons believe that the owl represents reincarnation because they are nocturnal and according to legends, owls contain the souls of people who have passed away who are waiting until morning to find a new body. Though less fantastical, they have also long been symbols of wisdom, the pursuit of which is a common theme in Freemasonry and the Illuminati.

#7 “Money Makings”- One secret that you probably weren’t aware of lies in what material the dollar bill is actually made out of. You may have wondered how something made out of paper can withstand so much wear and tear over the years and not disintegrate like normal paper would. Well, this is because U.S. paper currency isn’t made out of paper at all, rather a combination of  seventy-five percent cotton and twenty-five percent linen, which give it superior durability to plain old paper. These bills are also required to have red and blue fibers woven into the tight fabric for added security. The average dollar bill lasts around six years, whereas if it was made of paper it probably wouldn’t last more than a year under the conditions our money experiences.

#6. “Letter Code”- Unless you are completely oblivious to what you are putting in your wallet you have probably noticed the circular stamp-looking marking with a letter inside of it on the dollar bill. This is is the Federal Reserve Seal and the letter inside of it represents the reserve bank that ordered the bill. The number next to the seal, called the Federal Reserve District Number also corresponds to this bank. There are twelve of these banks across the country and each of them represents a different region of the country. If you see the letter ‘A’ and the number ‘1’ this means the bill was ordered by the bank in Boston. If you see the letter ‘L’ and the number ‘12’ the bill was ordered by the bank in San Francisco.",10 MIND BLOWING Secrets In US Dollars!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DSjpCk4pKI,5,,0,771,1410159,11255,1245,0,1300,1423959

So, I wanted to take a look at the writing process and see how we ended up with such a masterpiece of cinema. Now, there have been plenty of great videos on The Shining as well as videos specifically about the script, but I want to go deeper. What exactly is happening from a storytelling perspective? 

What was it like to collaborate with Kubrick on this screenplay? How did the movie wind up so different than Stephen King’s original novel? How close did they stick to the screenplay during production? What were Kubrick’s thoughts on horror? All that and more on this episode of Making Film...

moonlanding,"Sailing a Superboat Across the Atlantic in Record Time by Great Big Story 1 year ago 22 minutes 1,766,460 views","Even the most daunting world records are meant to be broken… eventually. For elite navigator Stan Honey and a crew of sailing all-stars, beating the prestigious monohull transatlantic sailing record was the ultimate accomplishment. And it was no easy feat. On July 22, 2016, the Comanche—a custom-built, 100-foot racing yacht—set sail from New York to the southern tip of England. Precisely five days, 14 hours, 21 minutes and 25 seconds later, the Comanche’s crew shattered the world record … by more than a day. Brave the high seas as we set sail on one of the most amazing and inspiring journeys ever to take place on film.

""Comanche: Across the Atlantic"" is a Great Big Film made in partnership with Land Rover (http://www.landroverusa.com/vehicles/discovery/index.html).

moonlanding,"The Battle of Midway 1942: Told from the Japanese Perspective (1/2) by Montemayor 2 months ago 41 minutes 2,694,717 views","(Animated Battle Map) 

This is part one of a planned two-part video covering Operation MI. As you can see I spent a considerable amount of time covering Nagumo’s Dilemma. To me it's one of most striking examples of how tough it can be for a commander to make a decision based on the information at hand. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the battle.

Corrections: 

""Strength"" , ""Auxiliary"", and ""unknown"" are misspelled in the video. 

At 22:55 I should have stated “North of Midway” instead of Northeast of Midway. The illustration shows a 10 degree 240 nm from midway location. Not so Northeast as I audibly stated.

At 23:43 I should have stated 79 aircraft instead of 78 and I should have displayed 35 instead of 34 torpedo bombers. the “mistake” came about because sources still differ on whether there were 27 or 26 Carrier attack planes (Kates). If it was 27 it would have been 79 Planes. if it was 26 it would have been 78. During the recording I somehow mixed up the numbers. 

Additional Notes:
notice that the carriers started off the battle in a box formation. This provided further mutual support for their rather weak AA fire. however, due to the incessant air attacks from VT-8, VT-6 and VT-3, the carriers were never able to reform in a box formation, instead they were in a ragged line which further worsened their AA capabilities. 

-----------------------------------------Spoiler Below regarding Nagumo's Dilemma---------------------------------------------

So what was the answer to Nagumo’s Dilemma?

“Taking all together, and admittedly operating with the benefit of hindsight, the “right” answer to Nagumo’s conundrum probably should have emphasized maneuver, offensive speed in preference to mass, and passive damage control. With fifteen minutes in which to act, he didn’t really have time to implement anything terribly fancy. But he could have helped himself immensely by immediately spotting every strike airplane in his hangars, whether they were armed or not, and launching them at the Americans. The sixty-four armed aircraft he had in had were perfectly capable of doing enormous damage to his enemy. And by emptying his hangars, he removed the single greatest danger to his carriers --- the presence of fueled and armed aircraft within them.”

November 2004, 90 miles of the coast of Mexico near San Diego, California, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was conducting routine training and aerial defense exercises when unexplained events occurred. No one could have predicted what would soon confront the world's most advanced naval war ships and fighter jets.  Aerial craft would appear that forever changed all those that encountered them. The answers to the question of “what are they?” remains unanswered by the sailors and the US Gov. After years of cloaked secrecy the true story can finally be told. With multiple witnesses from the ships, their first hand testimony is impossible to deny. 
Our film features CGI re-creations as told by the sailors and naval aviators that witnessed them. Aside from the historical fictionalized dialog (no one recorded the radio conversations), the story itself is based on the facts of the case, including official US government docs, witness statements, news reports and official timelines. See www.thenimitzencounters.com for links to the official documents.

moonlanding,"Footage released of China Jade Rabbit moon landing by The Telegraph 5 years ago 1 minute, 13 seconds 107,739 views","Chinese state television releases video of the Chang'e-3 space probe crash landing on the moon.

Chinese state television had so far only shown a computer-generated image of its path as it approached the surface of the moon late on Saturday. 

The 300-pound rover on board the probe separated from the much larger landing vehicle early on Sunday, around seven hours after the Chang'e 3 had touched down on a fairly flat, Earth-facing part of the moon. 

The mission blasted off from southwest China on December 2 on a Long March-3B carrier rocket. 

The silver rover is named Yutu or Jade Rabbit after the pet of Chang'e, the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology. 

The footage shows the surface of the moon getting closer and closer to the probe before it crashes into the dust. 

The video then shows the lander, covered in golden foil, standing in the Sinus Iridum or Bay of Rainbows, its solar panels open to generate power. 

The mission marks the next stage in an ambitious space programme that aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the moon. 

The rover will spend about three months exploring the moon's surface. 

China's space programme is an enormous source of pride for the country, the third to carry out a lunar soft landing - which does not damage the craft and the equipment it carries - after the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1976.

While descending, he released the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly on the Lunar Module's descent stage. A camera on this module provided live television coverage of man's first step on the Moon. On this, their one and only EVA, the astronauts had a great deal to do in a short time. During this first visit to the Moon, the astronauts remained within about 100 meters of the lunar module, collected about 47 pounds of samples, and deployed four experiments.

The eight-day journey was made possible by the careful deconstruction of the Saturn V rocket and Apollo spacecraft, and made use of a technique of docking components of the spacecraft in lunar orbit so the astronauts could land on, and then launch from, the lunar surface.

moonlanding,"Birth of the Moon by SpaceRip 7 years ago 24 minutes 2,205,957 views","Scientists have been reconstructing the history of the moon by scouring its surface, mapping its mountains and craters, and probing its interior. What are they learning about our own planet's beginnings?

Decades ago, we sent astronauts to the moon as a symbol of confidence in the face of the great cold war struggle. Landing on the moon was a giant leap for mankind. But it's what the astronauts picked up from the lunar surface that may turn out to be Apollo's greatest legacy.
 
When the astronauts of Apollo stepped out of their landing craft, they entered a world draped in fine sticky dust, strewn with rocks, and pocked with craters.  They walked and rambled about, picking up rocks that they packed for the return flight. 

Back in earth-bound labs, scientists went to work probing the rocks for clues to one of the most vexing questions in all of science. Where did the moon come from? The answer promised to shed light on an even grander question. Where did Earth come from? And how did it evolve into the planet we know today?  

The nature of the moon began to come into focus four centuries ago. Galileo Galilei had heard of an instrument built by Dutch opticians capable of ""seeing faraway things as though nearby."" Galileo, in many ways the first modern scientist, saw this new instrument as a tool to help settle a long standing question. 

What was the nature of the heavens, and how did the world of men fit within it?

To some philosophers, the moon was a perfect, crystalline sphere of divine substance, free of Earth's imperfections. Galileo, with his telescope, saw a more familiar reality. He noted mountains and valleys on the moon, features like those of Earth. 

The astronauts of Apollo lifted off on a series of missions to get a close up look at the moon and perhaps settle the debate. Because there's no atmosphere there, the astronauts entered landscapes that are nearly frozen in time. They could scour the lunar surface for evidence of events going back almost to the time of its birth.

Indeed, eons of impacts had opened up the Moon's interior, leaving a wealth of information strewn about their landing sites. Scientists had already noticed that some large old craters were surrounded by concentric rings. You can see one of the most pronounced examples in this image of the Mare Orientale, captured recently by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO. The colors show differences in elevation. 

The old view was that the impact had melted the rock below. A newer view held that the impactor had actually splashed down on a molten surface. That gave rise to the radical notion that, early in its history, the moon's surface was covered in a vast ocean of magma.

When the astronauts arrived, they found relatively light rocks known as anorthosites. Their presence suggested that heavier material had sunk toward the moon's interior, forcing lighter material to the surface. 

The rocks they brought back were found to be strikingly similar to those on Earth, in part because they share forms of oxygen, called isotopes, that scientists regard as ""blood types"" for solar system bodies. Then there was this. The moon appeared to be completely, utterly, dry, with no evidence that water was ever present on its surface.",Birth of the Moon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGTBJHFNywI,-1,,-1,1466,2208955,10655,932,0,3292,2223834

President Moon Jae-in is in Japan to attend the G20 Summit which starts tomorrow.
First up he held a meeting with his Chinese counterpart.
During the session Xi Jinping said North Korea 's commitment on denuclearization hasn't changed a bit.
Shin Se-min has our top story.  
Chinese President Xi Jinping says North Korea's will to denuclearize remains unchanged... and that it also hopes to push inter-Korean relations forward,... perhaps a game-changer in the rather slow denuclearization process seen in recent months. 
""North Korea's will to denuclearize remains unchanged. It is willing to pursue reconciliatory moves with the South and the dialogue track will stay the same."" 
The presidential office said, shortly after the fifth face-to-face between leaders Moon Jae-in and Xi in Japan,... who are both there to attend the G20 Summit,... that Kim Jong-un is hoping to swiftly address the impasse in nuclear talks... through continued dialogue..
Those are some of the takeaways seen from the Seoul-Beijing summit,... with the Chinese leader having embarked on a state visit to Pyeongyang just last week.

Our top story this morning...
A hectic day of diplomacy lies ahead for South Korean President Moon Jae-in as the G20 Summit in Osaka officially kicks off in the coming hours.
Later on this Friday, President Moon will take part in a leaders' session... where the member states will discuss the global economy and international trade.
He will also hold talks with a handful of his global counterparts, including a crunch meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key player in efforts to denuclearize North Korea.
Park Hee-jun reports from Osaka.
On the opening day of the G20 Osaka Summit on Friday,... President Moon Jae-in will engage in economic discussions... focused on addressing the global uncertainties brought about by the U.S.-China trade conflict.
A session will be held on the global economy, trade, and investment,... one of the four themes of the 14th G20 meeting.
President Moon is expected to share his government's fiscal policies,... including his push for a supplementary budget bill.
He is also expected to call for joint diplomatic efforts among the G20 nations,... in addressing global economic issues, including trade tensions.
With the G20 being one of the first bodies to take action,... in combating the global financial crisis in 2008,... active discussions will be held to prevent such a meltdown from happening again.

President Moon will also be occupied with a scheduled summit with Indonesia,... and pull-aside talks with India and the Netherlands.
But attention mainly focuses on President Moon meeting a key player in the North Korea denuclearization talks Russia.
This is perhaps the most important discussion of the day,... in terms of furthering his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.
President Moon is expected to learn of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's thoughts from Kim's bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in April,... and ask for Russia's continued support for his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.

""And besides the series of meetings,... there's the question of whether President Moon will be able to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Moon made it clear that he's willing to meet... to resolve the forced labor dispute between the two countries. He’s open to a last-minute meeting,... but this appears to depend entirely on Japan. Park Hee-jun, Arirang News, Osaka.""

President Moon Jae-in kicked off his schedule in Osaka with one of the most important meetings he'll have in Japan: talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
During their discussions on Thursday, President Xi who recently met North Korea's leader in Pyeongyang insisted the regime's commitment to denuclearization hasn't changed a bit... despite the prolonged lull in diplomacy.
Shin Se-min reports.
Chinese President Xi Jinping says North Korea's will to denuclearize remains unchanged... and that it also hopes to push inter-Korean relations forward,... perhaps a game-changer in the rather slow denuclearization process seen in recent months.

""North Korea's will to denuclearize remains unchanged. It is willing to pursue reconciliatory moves with the South and the dialogue track will stay the same.""

The presidential office said, shortly after the fifth face-to-face between leaders Moon Jae-in and Xi in Japan,... who are both there to attend the G20 Summit,... that Kim Jong-un is hoping to swiftly address the impasse in nuclear talks... through continued dialogue..
Those are some of the takeaways seen from the Seoul-Beijing summit,... with the Chinese leader having embarked on a state visit to Pyeongyang just last week.
Reaffirming that the regime is in sync,... the South Korean leader relayed his appreciation to Xi.

""Last week, President Xi visited North Korea for the first time since taking office, and I appreciate his constructive efforts to bring about the regime’s denuclearization and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.""

And the Chinese President also expressed his strong will to play an active role in pursuing the goal of peace, together as partners.

""If our two nations join hands, we can do a lot of things. China will pursue endless progress with Korea, and contribute to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.""

The Blue House official added that President Moon said denuclearization is intricately linked... to the resolution of other issues such as the deployment of an American anti-missile battery in South Korea,... which Beijing is asking for a solution to.

""The bilateral summit between Moon and Xi marks the start of a series of one-on-ones among major related players. President Moon's meeting on Friday with Russia's Putin,... himself close to Kim Jong-un,... should also provide Seoul with some insights into the regime's motives and desires.

Lyrics:

Time to Shine

(Looking at some controls)
Preparing to land our spacecraft on the Moon.

Houston, we have a song.

CHORUS
It's my time to shine
It's my time to shine
The day's over now
So it's my time to shine

MOON:
Good evening, it's the Moon
Here to regale you with a tune
I'm so bright up in the sky at night
But the truth is I'm just reflecting light
See lemme help you break it down
The Earth and I are spinning around
And I orbit the Earth in a loop

EARTH: ""You see, the moon is kinda like my hula hoop""

MOON:
We both orbit the sun; he's the big shot

THE SUN: ""I'm the center of the solar system, I'm so hot""

MOON:
The sun's like a lightbulb and I'm like a mirror
Light bounces off me and then it appears
To the Earth below for a lovely view
For animals like wolves who go ""Awhooooooo!""
Sometimes I'm full, sometimes half on
Sometimes I'm crescent, or it looks like I'm gone
But I'm here in the dark, just a lonely moon
Hoping that somebody will visit me soon
I'm covered in dust and I'm made of rock
So come see me soon and go on a moonwalk

MOON: It's my time to shine
It's my time to shine

Both at day

And at night

We can see the moon shine

MOON: It's my time to shine
It's my time to shine

I'm planting this flag on the mountain I climbed. One small step for a StoryBot

moonlanding,"NASA Opens Moon Rock Samples Sealed Since Apollo Missions by TicToc by Bloomberg 1 day ago 4 minutes, 24 seconds 5,129 views","Inside a locked vault at Johnson Space Center is treasure few have seen and fewer have touched.

The restricted lab is home to hundreds of pounds of moon rocks collected by Apollo astronauts close to a half-century ago. And for the first time in decades, NASA is about to open some of the pristine samples and let geologists take a crack at them with 21st-century technology.

What better way to mark this summer’s 50th anniversary of humanity’s first footsteps on the moon than by sharing a bit of the lunar loot.

“It’s sort of a coincidence that we’re opening them in the year of the anniversary,” explained NASA’s Apollo sample curator Ryan Zeigler, covered head to toe in a white protective suit with matching fabric boots, gloves and hat.

“But certainly the anniversary increased the awareness and the fact that we’re going back to the moon.”

With the golden anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s feat fast approaching — their lunar module Eagle landed July 20, 1969, on the Sea of Tranquility — the moon is red-hot again.

After decades of flip-flopping between the moon and Mars as the next big astronaut destination, NASA aims to put astronauts on the lunar surface again by 2024 at the White House’s direction. President Donald Trump prefers talking up Mars. But the consensus is that the moon is a crucial proving ground given its relative proximity to home — 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) or two to three days away.

Zeigler’s job is to preserve what the 12 moonwalkers brought back from 1969 through 1972 — lunar samples totaling 842 pounds (382 kilograms) — and ensure scientists get the best possible samples for study.

Some of the soil and bits of rock were vacuum-packed on the moon — and never exposed to Earth’s atmosphere — or frozen or stored in gaseous helium following splashdown and then left untouched. The lab’s staff is now trying to figure out how best to remove the samples from their tubes and other containers without contaminating or spoiling anything. They’re practicing with mock-up equipment and pretend lunar dirt.

Compared with Apollo-era tech, today’s science instruments are much more sensitive, Zeigler noted.

“We can do more with a milligram than we could do with a gram back then. So it was really good planning on their part to wait,” he said.

The lunar sample lab has two side-by-side vaults: one for rocks still in straight-from-the-moon condition and a smaller vault for samples previously loaned out for study. About 70 percent of the original haul is in the pristine sample vault, which has two combinations and takes two people to unlock. About 15 percent is in safekeeping at White Sands in New Mexico. The rest is used for research or display.

Of the six manned moon landings, Apollo 11 yielded the fewest lunar samples: 48 pounds or 22 kilograms. It was the first landing by astronauts and NASA wanted to minimize their on-the-moon time and risk. What’s left from this mission — about three-quarters after scientific study, public displays and goodwill gifts to all countries and U.S. states in 1969 — is kept mostly here at room temperature.

Johann-Dietrich Woerner believes the next giant leap for humankind could be an international collaboration of space faring nations in the form of a Moon village. This village would be a permanent lunar base for science, business, tourism or even mining.

Woerner explains how using the Moon’s own natural resources could help build and sustain a base by 3D printing a structure or building element. Robotic rovers could inflate protective domes for astronauts. He also discusses the potential hazards of living on the Moon as well as the possible locations of he lunar base and the advantages of a new global space project.",Moon Village,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amYK5voqLSk,5,,0,267,270254,2216,86,0,207,272763

A hectic day of diplomacy lies ahead for South Korean President Moon Jae-in as the G20 Summit in Osaka officially kicks off in the coming hours.
Later on this Friday, President Moon will take part in a leaders' session... where the member states will discuss the global economy and international trade.
He will also hold talks with a handful of his global counterparts, including a crunch meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key player in efforts to denuclearize North Korea.
Our Park Hee-jun reports from Osaka.
On the opening day of the G20 Osaka Summit on Friday,... President Moon Jae-in will engage in economic discussions... focused on addressing the global uncertainties brought about by the U.S.-China trade conflict.
A session will be held on the global economy, trade, and investment,... one of the four themes of the 14th G20 meeting.
President Moon is expected to share his government's fiscal policies,... including his push for a supplementary budget bill.
He is also expected to call for joint diplomatic efforts among the G20 nations,... in addressing global economic issues, including trade tensions.
With the G20 being one of the first bodies to take action,... in combating the global financial crisis in 2008,... active discussions will be held to prevent such a meltdown from happening again.

President Moon will also be occupied with a scheduled summit with Indonesia,... and pull-aside talks with India and the Netherlands.
But attention mainly focuses on President Moon meeting a key player in the North Korea denuclearization talks Russia.
This is perhaps the most important discussion of the day,... in terms of furthering his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.
President Moon is expected to learn of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's thoughts from Kim's bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in April,... and ask for Russia's continued support for his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.

""And besides the series of meetings,... there's the question of whether President Moon will be able to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Moon made it clear that he's willing to meet... to resolve the forced labor dispute between the two countries. He’s open to a last-minute meeting,... but this appears to depend entirely on Japan.

moonlanding,"If the Moon were replaced with some of our planets by yeti dynamics 6 years ago 1 minute, 43 seconds 27,654,352 views","In order show:

Mars
Venus
Neptune
Uranus
Jupiter
Saturn

Mercury is intentionally left off as it isn't Much bigger than our Moon (and hence is boring)

Everything is correctly scaled. The Axial tilts are not particularly accurate.
the moon that flies in front of Saturn is Tethys. It is Tiny. but *very* close


Dione would be on a collision course, it's orbital distance from Saturn is Nearly identical to our Moon's orbit around Earth

Titan, which is Larger than our Moon, is outside the orbit of Dione

****************
on Jupiter, you might be able to make out the 4 big moons, They all have orbits larger than our moons orbit. but I stuck them on the far side of jupiter so that they could be seen so it looks as if they are closer (to Jupiter) than they really are.

***************
Video creation method
I created an Earth Moon system in 3dsmax, with accurate sizes and accurate orbital distances.. I than matched video of the real Moon with my video camera, against my model. I also researched the correct FOV of my video camera. I used both methods to verify my Virtual camera's FOV (around 47 degrees). I next modeled up the rest of the planets in proper scale (Real values) set at the distance of the moon (also real values), created the animation of them rotating around, and composited the whole bunch.

***************
Faq:

Scales used in Visualization:
Celestial Body    Radius (in km)
Moon:                1738
Mars:                 3397
Venus:               6052
Neptune:            25,269 (equatorial)   24,340 (polar)
Uranus:              25,559 (equatorial)   24,973 (polar)
Jupiter:              71,490 (equatorial)   66,854 (polar)
Saturn:              60,268 (equatorial)   54,360 (polar) (not including rings)

Distance to Moon 384,000km


Faq: (will expand as needed)

1, We would not be engulfed by Jupiter or any other planet, Jupiter's radius is 71,490 km and the distance to the Moon is 384,000km

2, Saturn is not larger than Jupiter. Saturn + RINGS is larger than Jupiter

3, We would suffer from really really horrible tides, and Volcanoes And some pretty bad Radiation from Jupiter. It *could* strip away our atmosphere, but haven't done the math. Eventually our planet would become tidally locked (that is the same side of Earth would always face Jupiter. we would Still have some bad tides and volcanoes from being in a slightly ellipitical orbit, and from the other moons of Jupiter, and the Sun having tidal influence. I have not calculated how bad the Tides would be. A Simple guess would be at Least 300 times more exaggerated than they are now, This figure could be way off, it's simply an educated guess.

4, We would not be in the rings of Saturn. Or to rephrase that, we would not be in any of the Visable rings of Saturn, There are some very very faint rings that strech out far that we would be in, but i did not model them.

5, We would not be crushed by the Gravity of Jupiter, This is not how orbiting works!.
However, at the Roche limit, we WOULD become a new ring system, The Roche limit is *about* 36,000km above the ""surface"" of Jupiter or 106,000km from the center of Jupiter. So, to reiterate  if the center of Jupiter was 106,000km away from the center of the earth, Our planet would become a new Ring system of Jupiter.

6, I did not model the Ring of debris around Uranus (this faq will be deleted in a few days)

7, This is not an ad for any beer company, no one has endorsed me, or this animation, It's just the traffic that drove by. 

8, There is Ring Shine on Saturn, but it is very faint, the Rings are reflecting light onto Saturn in the animation. The moon that flies by is Tethys 

9, I love Pluto, and Mercury. They are left off because they are too small. Pluto is smaller than our Moon, and Mercury is not significantly larger than our Moon.

10, The ""Sun"" i used for lighting the planets is slightly off from reality, this was done so that they weren't totally dark and boring

11 FOV is about 47 degrees

12 Orbiting! Yes! we would be a moon of Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. They are much more massive than the Earth. Venus is about the same size of the Earth and we would orbit around a center point between us

13 Rotation rates and axial tilts are not accurate to anything

14 Radius of the Sun is 695,500 km, and hence if it were where our Moon is, we would be engulfed by it",If the Moon were replaced with some of our planets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usYC_Z36rHw,5,,0,103,27773522,124238,16031,0,20037,27933828

How did we get from one of the greatest technological achievements of the 20th century to believing that it was a massive cover-up by NASA, the CIA, the government or a combination of all three?,  and why almost 50 years after the first Apollo missions, with all the scientific proof available, do an increasing number of people believe in an a radically different version of reality?.
Conspiracy theory’s about the Apollo missions have been circulating since before the moon landings.
One of the first reported instances of people not believing that the moon landings were true came on  December 18th, 1969, 5 months after first moon walk, when the New York Times science reporter , John Noble Wilford in an article called “A Moon Landing? What moon landing?” remarked that ― “A few stool warmers in Chicago bars are on record as suggesting that the Apollo 11 moon walk last July was actually staged by Hollywood on a Nevada desert.”
Six months later, on June 15th 1970, the Atlanta Constitution led with the story “Many skeptics feel moon explorer Neil Armstrong took his ‘giant step for mankind‘ somewhere in Arizona”. The article was based on a poll of 1,721 U.S. citizens that were asked “Do you really, completely believe that the United States has actually landed men on the moon and returned them to earth again?”
The poll results showed that less than 5% of responders in Detroit, Miami, and Akron believed they were fake but that increased to 54% of African Americans in places such as Washington DC.
An early common theme was that because of the cold war between the US and the Soviets, the US could not be seen to lose the race to the moon but when they realized that it couldn’t be done, NASA faked the missions and used the funds to buy the silence of potential whistle blowers.
Other ones said that we could never get to the moon because the astronauts would have been killed by the radiation in the Van Allen Belts which surround the earth. This is down a poor understanding of the science of radiation and that all radiation is not the same. As we will see, It’s this “bad science” that is the underpinning of most the moon hoax theories” 
One theory by William Brian said that we did go to the moon but only with the help of Alien technology and NASA couldn’t risk the public finding out about this as they would have disclosed how they got.

Denial comes in all flavors. Some think the moon landing was staged, some think Tupac is alive, and others reject vaccines. If the United States learnt anything in the 2016 election, it's that social bubbles need to be broken down — so how do you reason with someone who ignores evidence or bends it to fit their worldview? This has been on Bill Nye's mind more and more since climate change denial has become a political issue rather than a scientific one. People can't change their minds instantly when their beliefs are ingrained, so it's not a matter of convincing them on the spot. Nye suggests working together towards scientific understanding by tactfully pointing out that perhaps this person is rejecting evidence because the alternative makes them uncomfortable. Understanding is a process, not a flip switch. Bill Nye's most recent book is Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World.

Transcript: 

Daniel: Hi Bill. My name is Daniel from Texas. My question is how do you reach someone who is maybe a conspiracy theorist or someone who is anti-vaccines, someone who is staunchly scientifically illiterate and agree with them on what a good source of facts is? Thank you.

Bill Nye: So Daniel. How do I recommend reasoning with a conspiracy theorist. Right now, the last couple of months I’ve been messing around with this idea of cognitive dissonance. This is to say you have a world view; You’re presented with evidence that conflicts with the world view; So you either have to change your world view, which is hard because you’ve lived your whole life with it, or you just dismiss the evidence and dismiss the authorities that may have provided the evidence. The authority could be a person or it could be a book. Or, excuse me, an article on the electric-internet-computer-machine.

So you dismiss the evidence, so that you don’t have this discomfort or conflict in your mind—this dissonance. That’s what I’m working with right now, and apparently the way to overcome that is to say, “We’re all in this together, let’s learn about this together.”
Present the conspiracy theorist with the idea that he or she may be rejecting evidence because it’s just so uncomfortable. And you’re in it together. We’re in it together. I’m uncomfortable too. But when it comes to moon landings, just ask the person how you would generate all that paperwork! The warehouses full of documentation that NASA created to make landings on the moon would overwhelm anybody trying to do it on the side. It would just be very difficult to print all that. 

And just understand it’s a process. Somebody who has a world view that’s inconsistent with evidence—and I may have some—it takes a while for you to turn around. Like the example of palm reading it’s not something that people reverse their ideas on immediately. It takes, in my experience it takes about two years for somebody to sort of look at palm reading, look at cold-reading or a tarot card reading for a while and then realize that these tarot card readers/palm readers are just taking information that you’ve given them, the client has given them, and feeding it back to you. 

It takes a long time and in the same way people who are anti-vaccine I think have just lost sight of the history. Vaccines—you know, part of the reason I’m able to be here talking with you is my grandparents did not die in 1918 during the Spanish flu when it is estimated 50 million people died—Twice as many people as were killed in combat in World War I died of this disease.

If you go to old cemeteries you can see these tombstones of very young people who died of the flu. So people just lost sight of history, and we all tend to go, “Well look at the facts. Change your mind!” But it takes people a couple of years to change their mind. So my recommendation, Daniel, is: stick with it! You’ll get frustrated, the person will get frustrated, but present the idea of cognitive dissonance. This is my latest idea about a way to work together to a scientific understanding.","Bill Nye on Conspiracy Theorists: NASA's Moon Landing, Vaccines, Astrology, and Tarot Cards",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFLtTK13G2w,-1,,-1,221,129462,2259,463,0,1098,133282

The moon landing proved one of the pivotal moments of the 20th century, and in modern human history. Neil Armstrong's 'one small step' was seen all around the world, and remains an iconic piece of footage for scientists, astronauts and star-gazers alike. However, conspiracy theorists forever insist that the achievement was a fake. So, how would the world be different if it was?

Put them together in a house, with no adult control. Watch what happens. Boys Alone tests the common belief that a pack of boys left together in a house for a long period of time, will self-destruct. In any group of boys, it is thought, fierce hierarchies will quickly form. The strongest and most assertive will survive; the most sensitive and vulnerable will suffer. But is it true? And if it is, how exactly does that process happen?

The immune system’s responses begin with physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, and when they’re not enough, there are phagocytes -- the neutrophils and macrophages. It also features the awesomely named natural killer cells and the inflammatory response, and we'll explain how all of these elements work together to save the day if you happen to slip on a banana peel.

View full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/cannibalism-in-the-animal-kingdom-bill-schutt

Until recently, scientists thought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation or other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals like the praying mantis and black widow were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more or less represent the rule. Bill Schutt shows how cannibalism can promote the survival of a species by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong.

The creation of the internet has opened up a platform for wild movie fans to let loose and discuss film theory in great detail. It has come to the point where people are basically rewriting the movies we thought we knew so well because of the underlying story lines they are discovering. Today we will be looking at what fans of Disney have been theorizing about. One group of theories we will look at has to do with family links that we never saw before. Fans have suggested that The Little Mermaid and Hercules are related as well as The Frozen sisters and Rapunzel being cousins. Other theories include the existence of alternate universes and posit that Zootopia and Robin Hood are in the same universe where humans don’t exist and that The Incredibles is set in a world where humankind has reached greater technological advances by the year 1960. In addition, we look at characters who are not as they seem. We argue that the merchant in Aladdin is actually the genie and that The Evil Witch from Snow White is actually Mother Gothel from Tangled. We cover everything from characters from other movies making secret cameos and the mystery behind the vehicles in Cars all having different accents. We hope that in within our list of twenty theories, you are shocked, in awe and hopefully at one point appalled by the knowledge we are dropping. Join us as we weave through the best of the best, the creme de la creme. Hopefully we blow your mind clean off.

Canada has been ranked 6th best country overall for gun owners by Guns & Ammo Magazine. 

There's a new type of gun owner emerging -- 20 years ago you needed to know someone with guns to be introduced to them, but today, young people are discovering guns online. This new generation of young gun enthusiasts is often simultaneously pro-gun and pro-gun control, almost fanatical about following gun safety laws. They're making shooting a fast-growing extreme sport. 

Despite somewhat high gun ownership and liberal laws, Canada’s gun violence is still remarkably low. What is it about Canada's gun culture and laws that separates it from the US? VICE talks to gun legislators and enthusiasts in Canada and the US to find out.

Wow! Thank you so much for supporting the Real Doctor Reacts to series. I said that if you get the grey's anatomy video to 15k likes I'll do another episode and you CRUSHED it by getting it 200k+ likes. I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] 

Full disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.

I really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.

I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor. If you want me to continue making this tv medical drama series please like the video and leave me a comment on which medical tv show or episode you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Bacteria, viruses, spores and more living stuff wants to enter your body and use its resources for itself. The immune system is a powerful army of cells that fights like a T-Rex on speed and sacrifices itself for your survival. Without it you would die in no time. This sounds simple but the reality is complex, beautiful and just awesome. An animation of the immune system.

We are thinking of making an App for tablets out of this video. Would you like that? Did you think the visual system we developed worked? Feedback is much appreciated!

The team encounters a teenage boy (Dominic Scott Kay) who collapsed from severe pelvic pain after playing basketball. The boy was born with a condition called genetic mosaicism (46, XX/XY), or both male and female DNA, and the boy's parents inform House and the team that the boy is unaware of his condition. They chose a gender for him when he was born and raised him accordingly. However, when his condition worsens and his life is threatened, the parents wonder whether they made the right decision. Meanwhile, Cuddy and Wilson suspect something is wrong with House when he starts acting way too nice.

About Ty & Charlene Bollinger
---------------------------------------
Ty & Charlene Bollinger are devoted Christians, health freedom advocates, health researchers, documentary film producers, and best-selling authors.

After losing several family members to conventional cancer treatments, they set out to learn the truth about cancer and the cancer industry, working together tirelessly to help others to learn the truth that sets them free to live healthy, happy lives.  

Ty & Charlene's heartbreak and grief coupled with their firm belief that chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery were NOT the most effective treatments available for cancer patients, led them on a path of discovery. 
 
On their journey, they interviewed cutting-edge scientists, leading alternative doctors, and groundbreaking researchers to learn about hidden alternative cancer treatments. What they uncovered helped to create The Truth About Cancer and its three awe-inspiring docu-series: ”The Quest for the Cures”, “The Quest for the Cures Continues”, and “The Truth About Cancer: A Global Quest.” 

Ty & Charlene speak frequently at seminars, expos, conferences, and churches. Together, they host a bi-weekly internet news program: TTAC Global Health News: http://bit.ly/ghn-episodes

Their message is clear: CANCER IS NOT A DEATH SENTENCE. THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE.

In this video, Neale Donald Walsch explain that you don’t have to mourn death because death isn’t real. Learn more with Neale's free Masterclass here👉https://go.mindvalley.com/Awaken-The-Species

Death is a fiction, it doesn’t exist. 

Death cannot occur in the experience of who you are — your soul, which lives far past the end of what you call your physical life. 

Would you be sad about falling down stairs that you never actually fell down? No. Then, why would be sad about a loved one’s death if that, also, never actually happened? 

We may mourn our own loss, but it doesn’t make sense to mourn their death. They wouldn’t want you to mourn their death. Rather, they would hope that you may celebrate their “Continuation Day,” the love and joy they expressed in physical form, and that they are now continuing to live in the free and wondrous expression of their evolutionary process.

In this video, Neale Donald Walsch explains all of this seeming impossibility, and shares some of the last words and sentiment of his mother. Those words were, “Dance on my grave, promise me.”

Neale did just that. 

When you’re fully awake, you dance through the moments that you once mourned… And you mourn no more.

This is also a tour of her Japanese office, Pasona.  We start this typical day in her Japanese home, commute via train to her Tokyo office in Otemachi and spend a day in the life of Emi at her working place.  We see her typical working hours in Japan and how it is working in Japan as a female in her position.  Her day in the life in Japan may be a bit different than some Japanese salarymen, but her experiences in the office with chorei, senpai / kouhai, and kenshu is a very typical in experiences in many Japanese offices.  If you want to know how work in Japan or want to know how work in Tokyo, this could be how your job in Japan could be like.  The Tokyo office itself, is probably an above average Japanese office in terms design and the business culture a bit more progressive than most traditional Japanese companies, but this Japanese company still maintains a very traditional Japanese office environment.  So all in all, this is an example of Japan life as well as Tokyo life if you were to work in a Japanese company.  You should always be aware of Japanese culture when working in a Japanese office.  This Japanese office has a gym, English school and even a farm all in the building.  Pasona is one of the largest staffing services company in Japan.  There’s about 4000 staff in her office alone and about 9000 in total worldwide.

We wanted to put assumptions to the test to see what we're missing out on because we're so busy assuming we already ""know"" a person. Join us as we discover why you should never judge a book by it’s cover in our series, Reverse Assumptions.

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to make assumptions about their partner's appearance without ever actually seeing their partner. When they flipped around to finally face each other, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now it's YOUR turn. What do people assume about you?

Kelley Benham and her husband, Tom French, had relied on technology through fertility treatments to have her. They named her Juniper and she weighed but one pound and four ounces. Born so prematurely, Juniper was given very low chances of survival and, it would be with a myriad of disabilities if she did make it: blindness, intestinal problems, cerebral palsy, and possibly much more. Produced by David Terry Fine and previously told by Radiolab, this short documentary is the story of a strong spirit in a tiny body and impossible decisions influenced by technological capabilities.

The episode ""three stories"" kept popping up with a lot of upvotes. I didn't get any background behind the story of the episode and I just sat down and watched it.

Now I didn't know it was going to be such a complicated episode to review as it bounced back and forth between three situations. So to simplify we decided to completely remove one of the three patient simulations as we felt it didn't add much to the story and just made it. more complicated for you to follow. 

I wish I knew this was the episode that went on to explain what is wrong with House's leg because then maybe I would've saved it for a later review. But I guess its good for me to know for further episodes anyway.

I will say this about Dr. House. I think he is a kind guy that comes off brash almost on purpose to be a better doctor. You can totally sense throughout the episodes that I've watched that he is still angry for his decision made in this episode. 

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches House MD / Real Doctor Reacts to House MD . If you want me to continue making this doctor reaction video please give it a  like and leave me a comment on which tv drama or show you'd like for me to review next. Love you all!

Ty & Charlene's heartbreak and grief coupled with their firm belief that chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery were NOT the most effective treatments available for cancer patients, led them on a path of discovery. 
 
On their journey, they interviewed cutting-edge scientists, leading alternative doctors, and groundbreaking researchers to learn about hidden alternative cancer treatments. What they uncovered helped to create The Truth About Cancer and its three awe-inspiring docu-series: ”The Quest for The Cures”, “The Quest for the Cures Continues”, and “The Truth About Cancer: A Global Quest.” 

Ty & Charlene speak frequently at seminars, expos, conferences, and churches. Together, they host a bi-weekly internet news program: TTAC Global Health News: http://bit.ly/ghn-episodes

vaccines,"Red Eye's Andy Levy on News, Satire, and Political Correctness by ReasonTV 4 years ago 9 minutes, 44 seconds 28,250 views","""To me, the best shows are when you're mixing it up...everything is more interesting when there's disagreement,"" says Andy Levy, co-host of Fox News Channel's Red Eye, which was described by the New Yorker as ""an odd and often funny late-night show that is not exactly satire, and not exactly anything else, either."" 

Over the show's eight years (and counting), Levy's role has evolved from being the show's ombudsman, where he would humorously take panelists to task for errors and exaggerations, to being a full-time panelist and occasional guest host. He is beloved by fans of the show for his sardonic contrarian takes, his hilarious takedowns of both Chris Brown and Stephen Colbert, and despite his self-avowed libertarian streak, his refusal to be pigeon-holed into tribalist thinking.

Levy spoke with Reason TV's Anthony L. Fisher about Red Eye's unique place in the news and comedy worlds, the diverse politics of the show's panelists, guests that go ""too far,"" and how the show will continue to evolve now that original Red Eye host Greg Gutfeld has left to host his own weekend show on FNC. 

About 9 and a half minutes.

Produced by Anthony L. Fisher. Camera by Jim Epstein with help from Brett Crudgington.

Jimmy Kimmel feels that people who are anti-vaccination are starting a snowball of silliness while Robert de Niro has a child with Autism and has looked more closely into the matter and now feels that there is much more to this than we're being told and that we should ask more questions and start a conversation without shutting it down that's why we've invited someone who's not just a real doctor but Dr.Toni Bark who's one of the leading Vaccine experts in America to help us get more educated and informed on the topic. 

If you have more questions contact Dr.Toni Bark
http://www.disease-reversal.com/contact-us

Whenever we are trying to gain understanding in any matter in life a good place to start is by praying two Rakat with sincere DUA asking Almighty Allah to guide us to the Truth. From there start asking questions, learning and slowly getting informed. Always have an open mind and heart and be humble in your search.

He has devoted the past 30 years to educating parents and health practitioners about vaccines, encouraging informed consent and non-mandatory laws. He is the author of several articles, studies, and books on vaccines, including Miller’s Review of Critical Vaccine Studies(www.vacbook.com), Vaccine Safety Manual for Concerned Families and Health Practitioners(updated 2nd edition), and Vaccines, Are They Really Safe and Effective? Past organizations that he has lectured for include the International Chiropractic Pediatric Association, the International College of Integrative Medicine, the Hahnemann Academy of North America, and the Culture of Life Institute. Mr. Miller has a degree in psychology and is a member of Mensa.

 

Mr. Miller began his crusade against mandatory vaccines when his wife was pregnant with their first child. Very little data could be found on this topic. His search for the truth led him to scientific journals where numerous studies warned that vaccines are often unsafe and ineffective. His shock and anger at the suppression of this information culminated in his passionate defense of parents seeking to make truly informed vaccine decisions while retaining the right to accept or reject them.

They’re ranked among the top 10 in a grade that’s placed over a third of its students in the National Honor Society. 

Despite the students’ impressive qualifications, they began to worry about their applications to elite colleges. An ongoing lawsuit challenging the consideration of race in admissions could harm the use of affirmative action in education. And the seniors — Ryan, Ethan , and Cadmus — are all non-white. 

The litigation, brought by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, argues that Harvard University has negatively stereotyped Asian applicants and held them to higher test standards and tougher personality assessments. The constitutionality and value of affirmative action has repeatedly held up in the courts, but if the lawsuit reaches the now conservative-majority Supreme Court, the decision could alter the way all colleges consider diversity in admissions. 

VICE News documented the experiences of the three students as they grappled with the lawsuit’s potential effects and the stress of early action application deadlines.

vaccines,"Anti-Vaxxers And Fear Caused Minnesota's Measles Outbreak (HBO) by VICE News 1 year ago 6 minutes, 27 seconds 139,778 views","Abdinasir Fidow, a Somali father of seven living in Minneapolis, had heard of the measles outbreak spreading in his state, the worst flare-up in Minnesota in three decades. But even fear of the potentially deadly virus wasn’t enough to motivate Fidow to inoculate five of his children with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. “I’m not willing to do that, because I’m scared for the MMR,” Fidow said. “I don’t want to lose another kid again.”

Fidow’s eldest son, Abdullahi, 14, did get the vaccine, over a decade ago. A few months later, Fidow said, Abdullahi was diagnosed with autism and severe intellectual disabilities. Despite all scientific evidence to the contrary, Fidow believes that his son’s diagnosis is directly linked to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine — a belief shared by Somali parents he knows.

For many in the Somali community, autism is an American-born condition. Those in the neighborhoods around the “Somali Mall” in Minneapolis, a city that houses the largest Somali population in the country, hadn’t even heard the word “autism” before coming to the U.S. from Somalia, where the measles vaccine is also less common. Yet for almost a decade, fewer and fewer Somali children in Minnesota are inoculated because of their parents’ fears, propelled by bad science and anti-vaxxer efforts, of autism diagnoses. Now, Minnesota has seen more measles cases just since April than the entire U.S. in all of 2016. And 84 percent of those cases have occurred in the Somali community, mostly in children.

The number of cases of measles in England has almost quadrupled in the past year, leading the head of the health service to issue a warning about the growing number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children. 

An analysis by the charity Unicef found that among high-income countries, the UK had the third largest number of children who had missed their first dose of the measles vaccine. 

The Health Secretary said today he was ""particularly worried"" anti-vaccine fake news was being spread online.

Lost Arts Radio Show on Sunday 5/26/19

Listen online: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lostartsradio

Vaccines have saved millions of lives and are perhaps the greatest advance in health science in the last 200 years. We should all be overwhelmed with gratitude for their discovery by the great ones of science. In fact, we should be so grateful that we should never look at their destructive effects, or the cases where they have spread disease or killed people who received them, especially children. No, really that's not good enough, we need to criminalize talking about any possible drawbacks of vaccines whatsoever. After all, questioning vaccines is, at its root, hate speech, and we all know hate speech is offensive and should be prohibited, backed up by the threat of heavy fines and prison time. It's the least we can do for our children, and our ""democracy"".

Except for one important detail. America was founded on the idea that people everywhere are born with certain inalienable rights that come directly from God, and this applies no matter in what part of the world a person may live. These rights include freedom of speech about all subjects. But they also include informed consent, which was further confirmed in the Geneva Convention on Informed Consent following the Nuremburg Trials. Informed Consent means no one can perform any medical treatment on any of us without our complete understanding of what is being done, what may happen to us as a result, and unless we freely give our permission for it to be done to us, after knowing these things.

So, after fully understanding a proposed medical treatment, if you do not wish to have it done to you, no one is allowed to subject you to that treatment. That means compulsory vaccination laws in states such as California and New York are void and cannot legally be enforced. But there is more.

After vaccine companies and individuals administering vaccines were given immunity from liability that had arisen due to lawsuits by parents of injured children and from other vaccine victims, Congress also declared that HHS must direct FDA to perform certain tests yearly to prove that vaccines were becoming safer and that they would not harm those who took them. FDA ignored that mandate from 1987 through today. Ralph Fucetola, J.D. (http://www.tinyurl.com/stopillegalvaccines) and Dr. Rima Laibow, M.D. (http://www.drrimatruthreports.com) have a strategy of what to do to stop mandatory, unconstitutional vaccination in its tracks and save lives in the process. Yours could be one of the lives saved. Find out the details in this Sunday's show.

The Doctors debate: As measles make a nationwide comeback, are parents who refuse to vaccinate their children contributing to the problem? Or are the vaccinations more dangerous than the disease itself? Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center, shares the toll a vaccination allegedly took on her son Chris, who immediately after being vaccinated with a DPT shot suffered a convulsion, went into shock and lost consciousness. He was later diagnosed with brain damage and attention-deficit disorder.

Coming 202 years after the first vaccination by Edward Jenner, which led to the eradication of smallpox throughout the world, this recent incident is only the latest in a long history of questioning the benefits of vaccination.

From early irrational fears born of outdated medical understanding through to the latest medical research and findings, Professor Gareth Williams traces the history of the anti-vaccination movement and its long tail, reviewing the social settings in which the fears were found and offering a balanced assessment of vaccination as we find it today.

The transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the on the Gresham College website:

____________

With no written records from the Zulus themselves, historians and anthropologists have pieced together their history from a smattering of sources. We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.

While climate change is partially to blame for California's deadliest fire, most residents of Paradise, California almost immediately pointed the finger at the largest utility company in the state. The investigation into what caused the Camp Fire is still ongoing, but PG&E cited “actual and potential liabilities” in its decision to file for bankruptcy.

VICE News was in Paradise immediately after the Camp Fire to meet residents and learn how California can survive a future of deadlier fires.

Hong Kong is the most expensive housing market in the world. It has been ranked as the least affordable housing market on Earth for eight years in a row, and the price per square foot seems to be only going up. The inflated prices are forcing Hongkongers to squeeze into unconventionally small spaces that can affect their quality of life. 

Tens of thousands of Hongkongers are living in spaces that range from 75 to 140 square feet. To put that in perspective, the average parking space in the US is about 150 square feet. And in the most extreme cases, Hongkongers have resorted to homes the size of a coffin. 

I spent some time exploring the living situation in Hong Kong to find out why housing has become so expensive and spaces so tight. 

To understand how Hong Kong’s housing market turned out this way and see how it’s affecting people’s lives, watch the final episode of Borders Hong Kong.

In the Vaping question I mistakenly said it’s Propylene Glycol that causes popcorn lung, when it is actually diacetyl (found in some flavorings). I will constantly try to improve my knowledge and give you the most honest, evidence based medicine info. Thanks for watching, love you all! 


We are back at it responding to your comments and questions via this monthly video series. I love reading and responding to your comments and as you can tell I'll jump into the comments section with a reply or a heart quite often.

A couple favorite questions/comments from this video are 

1) Why do men have nipples?

2) Why do doctors smoke?

3) What are the health effects of vaping aka what are my thoughts on vaping ?

4) What medical procedure makes me nauseous?

5) Is pimping easy?

6) Do I have doctor's handwriting?

7) Can doctors prescribe themselves medications? 

8) My thought on makeup

9) Will I ever make an ASMR video?

Doctors are traditionally unreachable and I want to change that. So hop into this video’s and any other of my video’s comment section and ask dr mike! I want to see your username pop up on my next responding to comments video. 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

_x000D_
Join baby Jack and his #parents as they find out how #vaccines help train your baby’s immune system to help prevent disease in this #HowVaccinesWork video._x000D_
_x000D_
Vaccines contain a small number of weakened or dead antigens, the parts of germs that cause a baby’s immune system to go to work. After babies receive a vaccine, their immune system will remember that antigen and attack it if it ever enters the body again. Vaccines only contain a tiny fraction of the antigens that babies encounter in their everyday surroundings. _x000D_
_x000D_
It may take a few weeks for a vaccine to start working. Babies may also need more doses later to protect them. That’s why the recommended immunization schedule exists: it’s designed to give babies the best protection against 14 serious diseases by two years old. _x000D_

Suzy Scherf is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist. She received her PhD from the Univ. of Pittsburgh and did her post-doctoral training in the medical school at Pitt and also at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, she is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Penn State University. She uses multiple neuroimaging techniques to study brain development in typically developing children and adolescents as well as those with autism. Her work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, National Alliance for Autism Research, and Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services. Currently, she is working on understanding how children and adolescents perceive and interpret social signals and how pubertal development and emerging functional specificity of the developing brain supports this process.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

This isn't just something that's happening in the United States – it's happening throughout the world. Often, these outbreaks begin with unvaccinated people. They spread through them, too. Outbreaks occur because of a breakdown in herd immunity. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

Are vaccines safe? How do vaccines work? Why do some people claim there is a link between vaccines and autism?

Diseases that were largely eradicated in the United States a generation ago—whooping cough, measles, mumps—are returning, in part because nervous parents are skipping their children’s shots. The new NOVA special ""Vaccines – Calling the Shots"" takes viewers around the world to track epidemics, explores the science behind vaccinations, hears from parents wrestling with vaccine-related questions, and sheds light on the risks of opting out.

vaccines,"Facts about the Measles (MMR) Vaccine | UCLA Health by UCLA Health 4 years ago 2 minutes, 34 seconds 53,360 views","As measles cases continue to increase nationwide following an outbreak at Disneyland, doctors are urging parents to learn the facts about the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.

27 counties in California still have dangerously low kindergarten vaccination rates, and statewide the percentage of kindergartners with personal belief exemptions has been rising steadily since 2002.

Dr. Dennis Woo, a pediatrician at UCLA Health Santa Monica, has been fielding calls from worried parents. 

“I am convinced that most people make this decision not based on fact but on feeling.” Dr. Woo said, adding those feelings are influenced by what parents have heard from friends.

Carrie Swearngin, mother of a two year old boy, said she has friends who urged her not to vaccinate her son Samuel. 

“They were in our ear about it a little bit,” she said.

Friendly advice aside, what does the scientific evidence actually show about the safety of the MMR vaccine?

“Facts are that many studies have been done to look at the safety of vaccines, and they're looking at large populations of children and it’s been determined that… autism is not caused by the MMR.” Dr. Woo said.  

The American Academy of Pediatrics has a detailed list of those studies with links to the published results.   

Among them, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a study comparing rates of vaccination among thousands of children, some of whom had autism, and others who didn’t have autism.  The study found similar rates of vaccination between the two groups.

Other studies have looked at the effects of thimerosal (mercury), a vaccine preservative that some parents believed caused autism.

A scientific review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found no connection between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.  Nevertheless, in 2001 thimerosal was removed or reduced to trace amounts in all childhood vaccines except for one type of influenza vaccine, for which alternatives without thimerosal are available upon request.

“We effectively have removed mercury or thimerosal from all the children’s vaccines and we have not seen any drop in autism.  So clearly, autism is not caused by thimerosal,”  Dr. Woo said.  

Other parents voice a concern about kids getting too many vaccines at once, and whether all of them are needed.  

A 2013 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics looked at this concern of “too many vaccines too soon.”  The study examined the medical records of about a thousand children, how many vaccines they got, and found no connection between the number of vaccines they got, and whether they developed autism.  Researchers also note that the amount of antigens (immune stimulating material) in modern vaccines is much lower than those in older vaccines used in the 1990’s.

“Children’s immune systems are well suited to be able to tolerate all that,”  Dr. Woo said.

The MMR and autism scare was sparked by a 1998 study by British surgeon Dr. Andrew Wakefield, which linked the MMR vaccine to autism.   The study involved only 12 children.  The British Medical Journal launched an investigation into the study and found numerous problems in the way it was conducted.  It also found that Wakefield was paid $600,000 by lawyers trying to sue vaccine manufacturers.  Ten of the 13 author withdrew their support for the study’s conclusions.

In 2010, the medical journal Lancet completely retracted the study.  A British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, and violated basic research ethics rules.  British regulators revoked his medical license, saying he was guilty of “serious professional misconduct.”

After weighing the evidence, Swearngin went ahead and got her son vaccinated.

“He’s all set,” she said.  “We’re of the mind frame to listen to the doctor.”

The current MMR recommendation is that children get the first shot at 12-15 months of age, and the second shot between 4-6 years of age.   Dr. Woo said that if your child is up to date on the first MMR shot, there is no need to get the second shot early, unless there was a known exposure to measles.

Listen online: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lostartsradio

Vaccines have saved millions of lives and are perhaps the greatest advance in health science in the last 200 years. We should all be overwhelmed with gratitude for their discovery by the great ones of science. In fact, we should be so grateful that we should never look at their destructive effects, or the cases where they have spread disease or killed people who received them, especially children. No, really that's not good enough, we need to criminalize talking about any possible drawbacks of vaccines whatsoever. After all, questioning vaccines is, at its root, hate speech, and we all know hate speech is offensive and should be prohibited, backed up by the threat of heavy fines and prison time. It's the least we can do for our children, and our ""democracy"".

Except for one important detail. America was founded on the idea that people everywhere are born with certain inalienable rights that come directly from God, and this applies no matter in what part of the world a person may live. These rights include freedom of speech about all subjects. But they also include informed consent, which was further confirmed in the Geneva Convention on Informed Consent following the Nuremburg Trials. Informed Consent means no one can perform any medical treatment on any of us without our complete understanding of what is being done, what may happen to us as a result, and unless we freely give our permission for it to be done to us, after knowing these things.

So, after fully understanding a proposed medical treatment, if you do not wish to have it done to you, no one is allowed to subject you to that treatment. That means compulsory vaccination laws in states such as California and New York are void and cannot legally be enforced. But there is more.

After vaccine companies and individuals administering vaccines were given immunity from liability that had arisen due to lawsuits by parents of injured children and from other vaccine victims, Congress also declared that HHS must direct FDA to perform certain tests yearly to prove that vaccines were becoming safer and that they would not harm those who took them. FDA ignored that mandate from 1987 through today. Ralph Fucetola, J.D. (http://www.tinyurl.com/stopillegalvaccines) and Dr. Rima Laibow, M.D. (http://www.drrimatruthreports.com) have a strategy of what to do to stop mandatory, unconstitutional vaccination in its tracks and save lives in the process. Yours could be one of the lives saved. Find out the details in this Sunday's show.

18-Year-Old Ethan Lindenberger recently discovered that his parents never got him vaccinated. They are anti vaxxers (anti vaccination) and believed that a vaccine and vaccination might give him autism. Now that he's 18 and well versed in modern medicine knowing that vaccines are safe, Ethan decided to get vaccinated. Vaccine controversies continue, but this young man took his health into his own hands. Ethan spoke to Congress at a hearing on vaccines. He brought up evidence from the CDC and other scientific sources and talked about the debunked link between autism and vaccines. Vaccines do not cause autism.

Lost Arts Radio Show on Sunday 5/26/19

Listen online: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lostartsradio

Vaccines have saved millions of lives and are perhaps the greatest advance in health science in the last 200 years. We should all be overwhelmed with gratitude for their discovery by the great ones of science. In fact, we should be so grateful that we should never look at their destructive effects, or the cases where they have spread disease or killed people who received them, especially children. No, really that's not good enough, we need to criminalize talking about any possible drawbacks of vaccines whatsoever. After all, questioning vaccines is, at its root, hate speech, and we all know hate speech is offensive and should be prohibited, backed up by the threat of heavy fines and prison time. It's the least we can do for our children, and our ""democracy"".

Except for one important detail. America was founded on the idea that people everywhere are born with certain inalienable rights that come directly from God, and this applies no matter in what part of the world a person may live. These rights include freedom of speech about all subjects. But they also include informed consent, which was further confirmed in the Geneva Convention on Informed Consent following the Nuremburg Trials. Informed Consent means no one can perform any medical treatment on any of us without our complete understanding of what is being done, what may happen to us as a result, and unless we freely give our permission for it to be done to us, after knowing these things.

So, after fully understanding a proposed medical treatment, if you do not wish to have it done to you, no one is allowed to subject you to that treatment. That means compulsory vaccination laws in states such as California and New York are void and cannot legally be enforced. But there is more.

After vaccine companies and individuals administering vaccines were given immunity from liability that had arisen due to lawsuits by parents of injured children and from other vaccine victims, Congress also declared that HHS must direct FDA to perform certain tests yearly to prove that vaccines were becoming safer and that they would not harm those who took them. FDA ignored that mandate from 1987 through today. Ralph Fucetola, J.D. (http://www.tinyurl.com/stopillegalvaccines) and Dr. Rima Laibow, M.D. (http://www.drrimatruthreports.com) have a strategy of what to do to stop mandatory, unconstitutional vaccination in its tracks and save lives in the process. Yours could be one of the lives saved. Find out the details in this Sunday's show.

Join me, your host Richard Sacks, every week for fascinating discussions, amazing guests and useful information that you will not want to miss. If you want to support our work, please use the Donate button on our website, http://www.lostartsradio.com, and tell others about the show.

In addition to the Sunday shows and livestreams that introduce you to inspiring people and projects (http://www.lostartsradio.com), we are also entering our second year with Planetary Healing Club (http://www.planetaryhealingclub.com). PHC is a private, members-only platform, a supportive and interactive environment where I can speak with you freely about information that would be censored on the usual public platforms where most of our audio and video presentations are found. PHC is for you, when you're ready to really get deeply into special self-healing protocols and start transforming your life for the better. I'm there live to meet and talk with you every week. It's interactive, with live chat and plenty of time for Q&A, comments and any input you want to contribute. It's a rare opportunity for those ready to experience a radically better quality of life, and willing to do the work on themselves to make it happen. Learn more about it at http://www.planetaryhealingclub.com.

Finally, don't forget our news show on national and world events, for one hour every week at 7:30pm EST / 4:30pm PST, called Lost Arts Radio Live (http://www.lostartsradio.com/live). It's where we look at some events of the past week, and what the significance is for your life and for the future of our world. After ""Lost Arts Radio Live"" is a half-hour break, followed by our weekly meeting of the Planetary Healing Club, which you can join for a minimum donation of just $25/month at http://www.planetaryhealingclub.com. Meet me there when you're ready to transform your experience of life for the better.

In this video we're digging into anti vaxxers, pro vaxxers, and those caught in the middle. It's a lot of memes, a few stories, and a whole bunch of people caught in the middle. Have you thought about not getting vaccinated just for fun? Great! Except not. Get vaccinated. People say ""Do your research"", which unfortunately includes only seeking out opinion pieces rather than speaking to the experts.

Dr Rangan Chatterjee thinks you can. Often referred to as the doctor of the future, Rangan is changing the way that we look at illness and how medicine will be practised in years to come. He highlighted his methods in the groundbreaking BBC TV show, Doctor In The House, gaining him much acclaim from patients, his contemporaries and the media.

He is the author of the international bestseller, The 4 Pillar Plan - http://amzn.to/2yGfpuB which has been released in the USA and Canada under the title, How to Make Disease Disappear - https://amzn.to/2GstJf6 Rangan’s 15 years of clinical experience in the NHS includes internal medicine, immunology and general practice. A pioneer in the emerging field of progressive medicine, he also uses techniques from other disciplines he has studied including movement kinetics and functional medicine.

His own journey of learning was accelerated when family members fell ill and now Rangan is helping people to take control of their health by addressing the root causes of their illnesses, something which is often not achieved in 21st century health care, evidenced by a steady increase in the rates of chronic disease.

Rangan is a super-generalist, looking at as many factors as possible which can create wellness or illness. His talk is testament to how our thinking around the concept of disease needs to change to help form a map for future healthcare.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

» Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe

18-Year-Old Ethan Lindenberger recently discovered that his parents never got him vaccinated. They are anti vaxxers (anti vaccination) and believed that a vaccine and vaccination might give him autism. Now that he's 18 and well versed in modern medicine knowing that vaccines are safe, Ethan decided to get vaccinated. Vaccine controversies continue, but this young man took his health into his own hands.

2 years ago, when Ethan Lindenberger was 16, he began to question his parents’ stance on vaccinations. He said his parents believed that certain vaccines could cause autism. This claim is frequently refuted by The World Health Organization.

Lindenberger and his 4 siblings were never vaccinated for diseases like hepatitis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox some of which can be deadly. Lindenberger started doing research and presenting his findings  to his parents, but nothing seemed to work.

So in 2018, he turned to Reddit to ask for help. More than 1,000 commenters responded, offering advice and personal stories. Some offered to help Lindenberger navigate the legalities and logistics of vaccination as a teen  which are different in every state. In many states, minors can consent to hepatitis B shots without parental approval but must wait until they are 18 for other vaccinations. Lindenberger said he and his parents are on good terms now but it took them awhile to get there.

vaccines,"This County Banned Unvaccinated Kids From Public Spaces (HBO) by VICE News 1 month ago 6 minutes, 34 seconds 281,954 views","Joe Hendrick’s sons are part of a growing number of children in the US who have not been vaccinated. Their family has decided against vaccines for reasons that mix a firm belief in personal freedom with scientifically-unconfirmed concerns about what’s inside vaccines. But unlike most unvaccinated families, Joe’s family is facing a first-of-its-kind ultimatum: get your kids vaccinated or keep the out of all public places.

Last week, Rockland County, New York instituted a thirty day ban on unvaccinated children in public spaces, including schools. The county declared a state of emergency after six months of uncooperative people hanging up the phone, closing the door on inspectors, and refusing to report cases.

Dr. Patricia Ruppert, the Rockland County Health Commissioner, says there have been 161 confirmed cases of measles and that there are likely many more that they don’t know about. While 98% of the cases to date have been among Orthodox Jewish residents who live in tight-knit enclaves, the health department is fighting to communicate to the county that every single unvaccinated person, regardless of faith, bears responsibility for potential spread.

In the interim, Joe Hendrick has chosen homeschooling over vaccination. He's now juggling that with his job and a two-week old newborn child. When asked if having a new baby had given him any second thoughts, Joe explained that he felt emboldened. ""I'd rather move and make sure my family is safe and, you know, we have the right to choose for ourselves instead of being forced into something that could potentially hurt my child.""

VICE News traveled to Rockland County, where officials are trying to reach people who have put personal choice over public health.

Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/jabbedtv
Website: http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/jabbed

Diseases that were largely eradicated forty years ago are returning. Across the world children are getting sick and dying from preventable conditions because nervous parents are skipping their children's shots. And it's not just kids: adults, too, are being hard hit. Yet the stories of vaccine reactions are frightening, with rare cases of people being damaged, even killed, by vaccines. How do we decide whether to vaccinate or not, and what are the real risks? Jabbed, made by 2012 Emmy Award-winning Australian documentary filmmaker Sonya Pemberton, travels the globe to look at the real science behind vaccinations, tracks real epidemics, and investigates the real cost of opting out. Talking with vaccine-makers, alternative healers, psychologists, anthropologists, and parents, the film posing the potent question: what would you do to protect the ones you love? Two years in the making Jabbed will confound your expectations, whatever your position on the most important and divisive public health question of the decade.

Contrary to what is sometimes presented, the idea of vaccinations did not arise as a “eureka” moment. In Jenner’s epoch, variolation, or inoculation, was practiced using smallpox scabs or pus in healthy people to protect them from what was then a terrible plague.

02:09 CDC Recommendations for Pregnancy: The Tdap vaccine is recommended for women during pregnancy. Just a few decades ago, pregnancy was a sacred time, a time to protect an unborn child from toxins and other dangers

03:52 Tdap Pregnancy Vaccine Theory:

05:53 Lack of Data on Drugs: There are lots of studies, but few randomized placebo controlled studies. Vaccines get a special fast track.  One that upsets Dr. Thomas is the HPV Gardasil vaccine that is administered to teenagers to prevent cervical cancer in women.

08:43 Toxins, Toxins, Toxins:  At the time of the 1 in 1000 study in Norway, the US autism rate was 1 in 100. What toxins do we have in the US that they don’t have in Norway?  GMO is banned in most of Europe. They also do not do the hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. We have been doing this in the US for about 20 years. Hep B is contracted from sex and IV drug use, which babies don’t do. Babies can get it if their mothers have it. The CDC believes that 1 in 100 mothers have hepatitis B, however some studies say it is more like 1 in 1,000. We are injecting a 250 mcg toxic dose of aluminum to 99 out a hundred or 999 out of a thousand infants for a disease for which they are not at risk.

11:47 Flu Shots and Autism: There are studies that show an increased risk of autism if you have inflammation in the womb.

12:28 Genomics: There are hundreds of thousands of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms). Much research is being done.

13:48 Individualized Vaccine Approach: Families should be able to individualize the approach to vaccines. 

17:47 Dr. Thomas’ Shift to Integrative Pediatrics:

19:21 Developmental Delays: A policy in Dr. Thomas’ practice is if you start to see developmental delays, you stop all further vaccination. Each child is an individual and care must be tailored to what you are seeing.

20:31 Informed Consent: Doctors have been taught to never do anything to a patient without informed consent, explaining explicitly the risks and benefits of the procedure. Also explained must be the alternatives.

22:24 Herd Immunity: Herd immunity is a concept that if we vaccinate enough in the human herd, if the disease is introduced into the herd, it cannot take hold.

25:34 Vaccines and Pediatricians: Dr. Thomas’ book, The Vaccine-Friendly Plan is about far more than vaccines.

30:50 CDC’s View on Risk: Allergic reaction and severe autoimmunity issues are seen as risk by the CDC, but not family history, genetics or other impacts.

31:34 Pediatricians Must Think for Themselves:  It is time for pediatricians to stand up and return to informed consent.

Instead, the results show, parental concerns that steer young people away from vaccination tend to focus on safety worries, lack of necessity, knowledge about HPV and absence of physician recommendation, according to Johns Hopkins researchers who led the investigation.

The findings, published in the November issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health, could help public health officials and professional societies develop new interventions to increase rates of HPV vaccination.",The HPV Vaccine | Why Parents Really Choose to Refuse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jEtDE7_wWc,-1,,-1,285,60398,303,743,0,2498,63942

FRANCE 24 live news stream: all the latest news 24/7
http://f24.my/YTliveEN

Vaccines have been credited with reducing some of the world's most deadly diseases. But while the market for vaccinations has tripled since the turn of the century, representing over $25 billion a year, and is expected to continue to rise rapidly, more and more people are starting to decide not to take them. The number of measles infections last year in the EU was three times what it was in 2016, notably because some people had decided not to get immunised.
Dr Richard Halvorsen is the Medical Director of a children's immunisation clinic in London and author of ""Vaccines: Making the Right Choice for Your Child"". He gives us his perspective on the pros and cons of the inoculations. Dr Halvorsen says his main concern is the number of vaccines some people now take. ""We are adding more and more vaccinations. Some diseases we vaccinate against are mild or almost impossible to contract. Let's be clear: vaccines can save lives, there is no question about that, but also all vaccines have side effects."" 
As with all medication, Dr Halvorsen says each patient is a unique case and one has to look at the benefits to taking it compared to the risk of infection. While side effects are rare, like with all medication they can occur. ""We should be cautious when we add more and more vaccines for diseases that are less important,"" he told FRANCE 24. ""I'm not saying we should not vaccinate,"" he added, ""but we should have a debate about the benefits and risks.""

Flu vaccines have been shown to be highly ineffective and toxic for humans. It is a widely held belief that vaccines do not contain mercury or thimerosal. This is absolutely false. Most flu vaccines contain mercury in the form of thimerosal. They also contain a number of very harmful ingredients. Additionally, they frequently don't work and even cause a flu-like reaction, the very thing you're trying to avoid by receiving a vaccination! I say avoid them at all costs.

Download our How To Cleanse Your Body From Pathogens e-book for free:
http://bit.ly/2Givi3G

Edward Jenner was a physician and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine. Jenner created the first vaccine by scraping pus off the belly of a cow. 

The terms ""vaccine"" and ""vaccination"" come from Variolae vaccinae (smallpox of the cow).

Louis Pasteur’s 1885 rabies vaccine was the next to make an impact on human disease. The middle of the 20th century was an active time for vaccine research and development. Researchers targeted other common childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella.

Vaccines often get the credit for eradicating polio and smallpox from the face of the earth. But it was better sanitation and hygiene in the cities that prevented the spread of diseases.

The theory behind vaccines is that if you inject a virus into the body, it will create immunity against it. 

The vaccine-makers culture the virus in animal products. They take parts from monkeys, cows, sheep, chickens, pigs and sometimes dogs and rabbits.

Vaccines also contain aluminum, which causes dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Another substance in vaccines is formaldehyde. It is a highly toxic chemical that can cause cancer, brain damage, blindness, and more.

Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a brain toxin that attacks neurons and is often part of vaccines.  

Mercury is still used in vaccines. Thimerosal is lethally-toxic methylmercury that can devastate the nervous system.

​​Vaccination does not create immunity. You cannot become immune by ingesting poisons that destroy the immune system.

The body needs to use pathogens to heal a condition when the immune system is weak. Regular vaccination is one of the major causes of depleted immunity. Vaccines cause outbreaks of the same diseases they should prevent.

Vaccines cause autism in children

The best-documented side effect of vaccines ​is autism. Autism is a serious childhood disorder. Two chemicals often linked to autism is thimerosal and aluminum.

Babies are now given 25 vaccinations and combinations, before the age of two. More children developed autism since vaccines filled mercury spread on the market.

The dark side of vaccines

John D Rockefeller is the mastermind behind ​western medicine. Elite banker families like the Rockefeller and Rothschilds control our monetary system. 

The same families, control:

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The Food and Drug Administration

The pharmaceutical cartel, or Big Pharma.

The World Health Organization is also a Rothschilds Rockefeller creation. They use this organization to dictate global ‘health’ policies. It has a sinister agenda that includes mandatory vaccination.

Big Pharma works as one network, despite the appearance of different ‘companies.’ In the upper levels, they are all on the same team answering to the same masters.

Mainstream medicine is about wealth, not health. It is an ‘industry’ founded on human suffering, and the more suffering, the better. 

The vaccine lobby uses fear to force us to take vaccines. Mass hysteria fueled by the media, enable them to vaccinate millions of victims.

Eugenics explained

Elite banker families have plans to reduce the global population by destroying the human immune system. They want to reduce the world population to 500 million. The ‘Third World’ is a target for enormous population reductions. The plan is to kill people by releasing laboratory-created viruses and force vaccination. 

Swine flu scam

The depopulation cullers were behind the swine flu vaccination program. It was just an excuse to enforce compulsory vaccination for the manufactured ‘pandemic.’

How to get immunity against pathogens

Most people think of bacteria as dangerous and dirty, but they have an essential function. Microbes don’t cause diseases but instead play a vital role during the healing phase. These germs won't touch you unless your body is unhealthy.

What we choose to eat determines what bacteria species that will live in our gut. Good bacteria feast on plant-food remnants.  Pathogens thrive on a diet low in plant foods like meat, poultry, dairy, eggs or other junk food.

vaccines,"The abortion war | Fault Lines by Al Jazeera English 6 years ago 24 minutes 95,072 views","It has become one of the most vicious, important and divisive battlegrounds in the 2012 US presidential election.

Since it was legalised in 1973, the issue of abortion has polarised the US, but now the battle has been taken to a new level.

""What is abortion? Fundamentally it's the killing of an innocent child. If you can't get the life of an unborn baby right, I can't trust you with my taxes, education or anything else.""

- Troy Newman, the president of Operation Rescue

Last year, an unprecedented number of laws have been passed across the US, all aimed at restricting abortion or reproductive rights.

But the fight goes far beyond the medical procedure, with Republican politicians even attacking the Obama administration for making contraception more readily available.

The US has seen more anti-abortion violence than any other country in the world. Since 1993, at least eight abortion providers, including four doctors have been killed. And there have been over 200 arsons and bombings against reproductive healthcare clinics since 1977.

Why is a medical procedure being reframed as a deeply divisive moral issue in the US?

Fault Lines travels to California to meet the next generation of frontline troops fighting to ban abortion, and to Ohio and Tennessee to investigate what lies behind the so-called war on women.

""It [Ohio's heartbeat bill] really only sees a woman as a carrier and she has no other right beyond her ability to reproduce. One of the reasons that these abortion bills are so dangerous is because it chips away at the notion of personal liberty, your right. And what can be more fundamental to your personal liberty than being able to control your own body ....

Women died trying to get back-alley abortions. Do we want to get back to that in the land of opportunities, the land of freedom? When did it become a sin and a shame to be a woman in this country? But that is what is happening in the 21st century in many states across this country and also in our congress and it's just absolutely shameful to me.""

Nina Turner, Ohio state senator

But, given the nature of Scouting, the organization sometimes attracts men who prey on children.

In a co-investigation with the Los Angeles Times, the fifth estate looks at Scouts Canada's controversial system for recording the names of pedophiles who have infiltrated its ranks and been removed the organization. It was known as the Confidential List.

Host Diana Swain asks the question: have all of those allegations, going back decades, been shared with proper authorities?

The fifth estate's groundbreaking investigation follows a very public legal battle in the U.S. where the Boy Scouts of America were forced to reveal that it often did not inform police when allegations of sexual abuse were made.

The Boy Scouts of America has since paid out millions in legal settlements.

Asked for a quick pitch of the film, Scorsese replies with a single word: “Loneliness.” He also reveals that “You talkin’ to me?” was an improvised line. “It was like a jazz riff,” Scorsese said.

In the wake of the decommissioning of Mare Nostrum, a search and rescue operation run by Italy, the humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), launched their own vessel, named the Bourbon Argos, to find those stranded at sea and save those in trouble on one of the deadliest routes to Europe.

On board the vessel, refugees and migrants are provided with medical aid, food, and shelter, then brought safely to Italian shores. Having survived life in Libya, ruthless treatment by smugglers, and horrific conditions aboard flimsy boats, once aboard the Bourbon Argos they face yet more uncertainty as they approach Europe.

VICE News teamed up with MSF to document these search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean and speak to rescued refugees and migrants, hearing about the suffering they have endured in their attempts to reach a new life.

A former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, who accused him of attempting to rape a colleague 19 years ago, has called for a change to UK law on gagging orders.
Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s. She left after a co-worker said he'd tried to rape her, which he denied.
Ms Perkins told BBC Newsnight she tried to expose his behaviour but was told by lawyers she ""didn't have a chance"".
She signed a non-disclosure agreement but said the process was ""immoral"".
Ms Perkins was 24 when she signed the confidentiality agreement in 1998, which prevented her from speaking to anyone about the alleged sexual assault.
She's now broken her 19 years of silence - and the terms of her non-disclosure agreement - by speaking publicly about the movie mogul's mistreatment of women.

Where the foothills of Mount Kenya merge into the desert, the people of Samburu have maintained a strict patriarchy for over 500 years in northern Kenya. That is, until 25 years ago, when Rebecca Lolosoli founded Umoja village as a safe haven for the region's women. Umoja, which means ""unity"" in Swahili, is quite literally a no man's land, and the matriarchal refuge is now home to the Samburu women who no longer want to suffer abuses, like genital mutilation and forced marriages, at the hands of men.

Throughout the years, it has also empowered other women in the districts surrounding Samburu to start their own men-excluding villages. Broadly visited Umoja and the villages it inspired to meet with the women who were fed up with living in a violent patriarchy.

All mammals share certain characteristics, like warm blood and backbones. But despite their similarities, these creatures also have many biological differences — and one of the most remarkable differences is how they give birth. Kate Slabosky details the placental, marsupial, and monotreme methods of giving birth.

It's the latest example of Fox News’ transformation from right-wing news network into full-on Republican campaign operation. 

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

With billions of fans scheduled to tune into the upcoming 2019 Cricket World Cup, Hasan examines how the game has evolved from a sport of British colonizers into a tool of diplomacy and a force for good despite recent scandals and corruption. Hasan also explores how cricket has especially grown in India due in part to the creation of the IPL, a flashy professional cricket league founded by the infamous Lalit Modi, and how that expansion has unfortunately come at the expense of the growth of cricket in other countries.

For this Channel 4 documentary Jane Elliott, a controversial former schoolteacher from Iowa, is recreating the shocking exercise she used forty years ago to teach her nine year-old pupils about prejudice.

Elliott is asking thirty adult British volunteers - men and women of different ages and backgrounds - to experience inequality based on their eye colour to show how susceptible we can all be to bigotry, and what it feels like to be on the other side of arbitrary discrimination.

Does Elliott's exercise still have something to teach us four decades on and in a different country? Presented by Krishnan Guru-Murthy, the exercise is observed throughout by two expert psychologists, Prof Dominic Abrams and Dr Funké Baffour, who will be unpicking the behaviour on display.

First shown on Channel 4, Thursday 29 October 2009.

I thought I did everything right but the outcome was not what I expected. 

In life, there are many times when we have good intentions where the outcomes are bad. During those times we need to evaluate why that happened so that we can avoid repeating the same mistake over again.

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series this Sunday so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

WELCOME TO MEDICAL MEME REVIEW EP 5!!!! 

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

But Simona Zompi commends the brave souls -- a Buddhist nun, a boy, a cow, a dairymaid and physician Edward Jenner -- who first stopped the spread of this disastrous disease, to make us smallpox-free today.

More people have food allergies than ever before. Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and even milk… the list of possibly dangerous foods seems to get longer every day. But why do some people’s bodies have deadly reactions food?  And why are food allergies on the rise? In this video we explain what food allergies really are, and what the difference is between food allergy and food intolerance. Some fellow YouTubers tell us their stories of what it’s like to live with food allergies, and we bring you the best current science on how to prevent food allergies in kids and adults. It’s a tough nut to crack. #FoodAllergy #Allergies #FoodScience

Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

As the speaker states in the opening of their talk, this is their own personal theory of health. Please do not look to this talk for medical advice. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


We know that water conducts electricity in our bodies. But would you like to see how? What if you learned about a little something extra that could add a lot more zap to your zip? Dr. Seneff has all the data that you need.

A committed voice for sanity in science, Dr. Seneff has authored over two dozen peer-reviewed journal papers over the past few years about the connection between toxic chemicals and micro nutrient deficiencies in health and disease, with a focus on the dangers of Roundup (glyphosate) and the importance of sulfur. For more than three decades, her research interests have been at the intersection of biology and computation: developing a computational model for the human auditory system, understanding human language so as to develop algorithms and systems for human computer interactions, and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gene predictions. Her current work focuses on the relationship between health and nutrition.

Dr. Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Cambridge, MA. She has four degrees from MIT including a B.S. in biology and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science.

Kellogg's, the world's largest cereal maker, has seen its biggest drop in sales since the 1970s. Food companies are selling off their struggling bread divisions. It's all because best-selling health evangelists say that wheat is causing everything from fat bellies to schizophrenia. But do they have science on their side? Mark Kelley takes a hard look at what's driving a movement that is dramatically changing the way we eat.

Yet to this day, she has no formal qualifications to her name. Her career has been built upon a symphony of seemingly normal opportunities that evolved into extraordinary, life changing events.

Maisie tells the story of working on what ended up becoming the biggest television show of all time from the age of 12. She discusses why she thinks right now is the perfect time to build tools for communities and how her platform, daisie, will redefine creative collaboration.

Margaret Constance Williams, known as Maisie Williams, is an English actress. She made her professional acting debut in 2011 as Arya Stark of Winterfell in the HBO world phenomenon Game of Thrones. Selected among 300 British actresses, she plays the role of a tomboyish young girl from a noble family for which she won numerous awards.

Her broad artistic life led her to co-found Daisie, a social media aimed at creative people in the world of arts, fashion, tv, film, photography, music, and literature. The aim of the app is to bring individuals from across industries together, to help foster collaborations with other artists and provide an alternative route into creative industries. Maisie said “Our main goal is to have a community of artists that are collaborating, uploading their work and sharing their projects.. helping others create their careers.”

She began studying virology while obtaining her B.A. in Biochemistry from DePauw University. Working with ebolavirus throughout her undergraduate studies, she developed a strong interest in viruses, particularly viruses with ribonucleic acid (RNA) genomes. This interest was amplified as she worked with the RNA secondary structures of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses while earning her Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of North Carolina. Currently, she is a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University studying RNA structure and function of the poliovirus genome during viral replication. Her current research hopes to provide insight into the shape and structure of replication complexes of positive sense RNA viruses.

vaccines,"🇺🇸 Heroin's Children: Inside the US opioid crisis | Fault Lines by Al Jazeera English 1 year ago 25 minutes 1,592,007 views","The United States is going through the worst drug crisis in its history. It now claims more lives than gun deaths, tears families apart - and shows no signs of abating.

As US President Donald Trump declares America's opioid crisis a ""national emergency,"" Fault Lines looks at the ""invisible victims"" of the epidemic - a generation of children who are being neglected, abandoned or orphaned by parents addicted to heroin.

So, how is the opioid crisis shaping the next generation of Americans?

Josh Rushing travels to Chillicothe, a small Ohio town at the centre of the drug crisis, to meet a teenager who lost both her parents to drugs, a mother whose heroin addiction led her to overdose in front of her young son, a grandmother unexpectedly raising four granddaughters, pregnant women struggling with addiction, and police and firefighters responding to harrowing overdose scenes.

For more information, visit: http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2014-2015/orange-juice-juicy-secrets
Marketplace bites into breakfast, spilling juicy secrets about premium orange juice and putting popular breakfast sandwiches to the test.

About two-thirds of us have bought premium orange juice in the past six months, many convinced by claims of pure and natural juice, which make it seem like oranges fall off the tree into the carton. But that’s not the whole story. Tom Harrington talks to juice lovers and an expert who wrote the book on OJ, revealing just how much it is processed and what the labels don’t tell you.

vaccines,"We Talked To 18 Teachers In Oklahoma Calling It Quits (HBO) by VICE News 11 months ago 8 minutes, 17 seconds 673,061 views","Eric Weingartner worked two side jobs in addition to his role as a full-time 4th grade teacher to make ends meet. Chemistry teacher Becky Smith’s monthly paycheck rose just $300 in sixteen years. Aimee Elmquist spent her own money to stock her biology classroom. Mary West was did the same for high school art. 

Teachers in Oklahoma have been doing more with less for over a decade now: state funding for schools has decreased over 25 percent in the last 10 years, the state ranks ranks dead last in teacher pay, and almost a quarter of its school districts transitioned to a four-day school week to save money on things like electricity and janitor hours. Earlier this year, 30,000 teachers walked out of their classrooms in an effort to change on that. 

“It was this super hopeful environment. We were all down there, we were all together, working for the same thing,” Elmquist says. “The atmosphere was good; we felt like we had a lot of support.”

After nine days, the Oklahoma Education Association, the largest teacher’s organization in the state, called off the walkout and teachers returned to their classrooms without additional funding or raises. And now we’ve learned something else: Maybe it’s time to leave the classroom, for good.

“It wasn't until the day they announced that the walkout ended without teacher input that I knew. We have to leave,” says Sierra Thompson, a 9th grade teacher in Tulsa. “It was actually the next day that I started applying for jobs.” 

VICE News spoke to 18 teachers who are closing their classroom doors one last time.

She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around? A look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war.

The answers to living a long and happy life may come from Japan which has the longest average life expectancy in the world (83.84 years) and where 2 million people are over the age of 90. Believe it or not, 6 of the top 10 oldest people alive are from Japan including Nabi Tajima of Kagoshima who is 117 years old and the last human alive born in the 19th century! 

How did so many Japanese get to live so long? 
What are some of the things Japanese do right? 

In this episode, John travels to Tottori Prefecture to the area around Mt Daisen where his friend Tomiko-san gives him some advice about how to live a long life and how she's lived to be 106 years old and still working on the farm! 

Her secret? 
Tofu. 

She started to make tofu in the 1950s when doctors said residents had to reduce high blood pressure. She made her own tofu for her family and her diet combined with good habits including staying busy and working hard have strengthened her mind and body. She still walks and writes tanka poetry. 

I also ask Mr. Seiichi, my 97 year old Japanese neighbor his secret and hear from a Shinto priest about his thoughts and personal experiences with living a very long and happy life in Japan. 

It's impossible to say exactly what has led to Japan having the longest average life expectancy in the world but these things may help:

★ Green Tea
★ Less fatty foods
★ Seafood
★ Fermented foods
★ Bath culture / Hot Springs & Onsen
★ Smaller portions
★ Education on personal responsibility
★ National safety / low crime rates
★ Respect for the Elderly (It's a national holiday too!)
★ DNA

Special thank you to Daisen Town & Yonago City in Tottori Prefecture for the help. Daisen is celebrating its 1300th anniversary this year and you're invited to the party in June 2018! http://www.daisen1300.org/

At least one million of them are believed to be living in what the U.N. described as a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy,” while many Uighur children are taken to state-run orphanages where they're indoctrinated into Chinese customs.

The Uighurs' plight has largely been kept hidden from the world, thanks to China’s aggressive attempts to suppress the story at all costs.

VICE News’ Isobel Yeung posed as a tourist to gain unprecedented access to China’s western Xinjiang region, which has been nearly unreachable by journalists.

She and our crew experienced China’s Orwellian surveillance and harassment first-hand during their time in Xinjiang, and captured chilling hidden-camera footage of eight Uighur men detained by police in the middle of the night. We spoke with members of the Uighur community about their experience in these camps, and about China’s attempts to silence their history and lifestyle under the cover of darkness.

911,"Top 10 Bone-Chilling Titanic Facts by maj 3 years ago 5 minutes, 56 seconds 2,483,055 views","Top 10 Titanic facts that will shock you! Enjoy these facts about the Titanic. April 15, 1912. All was calm aboard the RMS Titanic, and most passengers had already turned in for the night. Little did they know that the ship of dreams would become an underwater grave. This is MajorTop10, and you’re watching Top 10 Bone-Chilling Titanic Facts. Now here are 10 facts about the Titanic.

Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/YouTubeMajorTop10

Number 10. Fred Fleet, one of the Titanic survivors, believed the Titanic could have completely avoided the iceberg had the binoculars been used instead of stowed away in an officer’s locker.
Number 9. Ramon Artagaveytia survived the sinking of the ship America in 1871. He overcame his fear of sailing and decided to sail on the Titanic. According to Ramon, it was the new system of communication, the wireless telegraph that alleviated his fear. After all, the Titanic had the ability to communicate instantly with the world. Unfortunately, he was found among the dead a week after the disaster.
Number 8. After the Titanic sank, families of the ship’s band members had quite a difficult time collecting death benefits. The White Star Line wouldn’t pay because the band members were contracted employees. The talent agency wouldn’t pay because they were listed as Second Class Passengers, and they felt the Cruise Line should pay. In fact, some of the family members received a bill from the talent agency for the uniform the musicians were forced to buy as members of the Titanic band!
Number 7. The morning before the disaster, a lifeboat drill was scheduled for the crew to prepare themselves for what they hoped would be an emergency situation they’d never encounter. However, the drill was inexplicably canceled by Captain Edward John Smith himself. It is still not known exactly why he decided to call off the lifeboat drill.
Number 6. One ship, the Californian, was even closer to the Titanic than the Carpathia was. The Californian saw the flares sent up from the Titanic. Regrettably, the captain of the Californian chose to ignore the distress signals, and the ship’s wireless operator had already gone to bed. Had the Californian chosen to investigate the flares, many more lives could have been saved.
Number 5. Violet Constance Jessop was an ocean liner stewardess and nurse who survived the accident aboard the Olympic, the sinking of the Titanic, and the sinking of the Britannic when it hit an underwater mine. Interestingly, all three of these ships were sister ships, and all three encountered major disasters in the same decade. According to Violet, the one thing she missed most immediately following the Titanic disaster was her toothbrush.
Number 4. While conditions on the Titanic were quite lavish for the rich, they were not so nice for the poor. The 700 third-class, or steerage passengers as they were also called, only had two bathrooms, and four passengers were assigned to a room. Despite this, the Titanic’s third-class accommodations were actually nicer than the typical living conditions that the third-class passengers were accustomed to at home. The cabins had running water and electricity, and the steerage passengers were provided with meals.
Number 3. Dorothy Gibson, an American movie star, was undoubtedly one of the more famous passengers on the Titanic and was also one of the survivors. One month after the disaster, Dorothy starred in a silent film called Saved from the Titanic, which was based on her experiences on the night the Titanic sank. She even wore the same clothes she had worn aboard the Titanic that night – a white silk evening dress topped with a cardigan and polo coat.
Number 2. Unfortunately, because the Titanic is over 2 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. Due to rust and iron eating bacteria, the wreck of the Titanic will be destroyed within 20 years and will soon be nothing more than a rust stain at the bottom of the Atlantic. On the positive side, more of the interior will become accessible as the outer structure disappears. This will allow researchers to gather more information on the ship before it is completely obliterated. 
Number 1. Fourteen years before the Titanic sank, a novel was written by Morgan Robertson called Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan. The details of this fictitious ship named Titan were uncannily similar to the Titanic. Triple screw propellers – check. Practically unsinkable – check. Shortage of lifeboats – check. Struck an iceberg on the starboard side on an April night in the North Atlantic 400 nautical miles from Newfoundland – check, check. Sank with more than half of the passengers drowning. Checkmate.
What would your final words have been if you sank with the Titanic? Dive down to the comments section and let me know.

If you live somewhere where YTRed isn't available, there will probably be a one-time purchase option. 

I'm really excited about trying this out. I love documentary film so much, it's right in our wheelhouse. In it's best form, it is entirely about finding ways to understand the world more complexly. And this is such a great movie to start with. In a difficult and complicated moment in our history, we have to take time to be calm and appreciate our world for a moment. I hope you get a chance to do that with this movie. 

 - Hank

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130
The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily-armed ground-attack aircraft. The basic airframe is manufactured by Lockheed, and Boeing is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. It is a variant of the C-130 Hercules transport plane. The AC-130A Gunship II superseded the AC-47 Gunship I in the Vietnam War.

The gunship's sole user is the United States Air Force, which uses AC-130H Spectre and AC-130U Spooky variants. The AC-130 is powered by four Rolls-Royce T56-A-15 turboprops and has an armament ranging from 20 mm Gatling guns to 105 mm howitzers. It has a standard crew of twelve or thirteen airmen, including five officers (two pilots, a navigator, an electronic warfare officer and a fire control officer) and enlisted personnel (flight engineer, electronics operators, and aerial gunners).

The US Air Force uses the AC-130 gunships for close air support, air interdiction, and force protection. Close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting convoys, and flying urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include defending air bases and other facilities. Currently, AC-130U Spooky model gunships are stationed at Hurlburt Field in Northwest Florida and the AC-130H models are stationed at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. The gunship squadrons are part of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), a component of United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM).

911,"The Quack That Wants You to Drink Hydrogen Peroxide by Myles Power 6 months ago 29 minutes 187,113 views","Pseudoscience is everywhere – on daytime television, on nearly every organic food label, and, most of all, online. Here, due to the lack of any real legal consequences, quackery is rampant and showing no sign of slowing down or going back to the dark ages where it belongs. The industry is becoming so massive and lucrative that it is spawning its own cottage industry made from its own victims. These once duped chumps have now become the self-proclaimed health experts and they seem to be fighting it out to see who can promote the most bizarre cure-all tonic. Recently, I have become aware of Justine Iannello Haynes who want you to drink hydrogen peroxide.
Justine runs the YouTube channel, ‘Happy Health’, and calls herself a “nutritional consultant”. Like so many of these second-generation quacks, Justine has turned her back on the old ways in favour of promoting more radical, maverick, and natural remedies. So what, you are probably asking yourself, natural remedies does this  “nutritional consultant” recommend that you consume. Justine promotes the consumption of the pola solvent DMSO, the industrial bleach MMS, the household laundry and cleaning compound borax, magnetised water, and the bleaching agent hydrogen peroxide, to name a few.

Ben Shapiro is notorious for ""DESTROYING"" all those who dare to debate him or hold different views.

In this video, BBC's veteran interviewer, Andrew Neil, gives Shapiro a hard time by continuously bringing up old tweets and things he said, then holding his feet to the fire.

Neil wins this battle of attrition in the end when Ben takes his microphone off and storms off ending the interview early.

It goes to show that the power of high emotion is strong enough to derail even the most composed of us!

In March of 2013 she started a petition asking Kraft to stop “using dangerous food dyes in our mac & cheese” It gathered 365,806 signatures which forced Kraft’s hand to not only remove the artificial dyes from their mac & cheese, but also prompted them to remove all synthetic dyes from their entire product line. It was another victory for the Food Babe, but was it a victory for the american consumer? or had they been misinformed by a charlatan? Let’s find out by going through her argument to remove the dyes one by one.

The failure of the search has had an unbearable impact on the family and friends of the 239 people on board, who are presumed dead. But Danica Weeks, whose husband Paul was one of the passengers, refuses to give up. With Sarah Abo’s assistance, she has achieved what many think is impossible and arranged a face-to-face meeting with the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad – the first time he has met with a relative of a passenger on MH370. The Perth mother-of-two has pleaded with him to continue searching for the plane. And as our story reveals, Dr Mahathir has been clearly touched by Danica Weeks’ determination, ordering his Minister of Transport to give 60 MINUTES world-first access to the secret vault where recovered parts of the plane’s wreckage are stored. It’s a degree of investigative transparency from Malaysia that is unheard of, and signals a major step forward.

911,"Wolfgang Halbig: Former Darling of the Sandy Hook Conspiracy Movement and ‘Nobody’ by Myles Power 10 months ago 18 minutes 106,319 views","Earlier in the year, I took it upon myself to fact check one of #AlexJones’ many videos on the subject. The video I chose was titled, “FBI Says Nobody Killed at Sandy Hook Massacre” which was a 30-minute interview between Alex and the prominent #SandyHook #Conspiracy theorist, Wolfgang Halbig. In the video, the two discussed what they considered to be the best evidence for a conspiracy, which can be boiled down to them misreading paperwork, misinterpreting a 2-second aerial video clip, and not understanding how chroma-keying works. 

The focus of my video was on Alex and not Wolfgang, who I dismissed as “some nobody”. My blatant disrespect infuriated many who believe in the conspiracy, and they soon took to my comments section where they informed me of Wolfgang’s credentials. It turns out that he is an expert in school shootings, and was hired by the U.S. government as an advisor after the Columbine massacre. If you look a bit deeper, you find out that Wolfgang says he is also a former Florida State Trooper, and United States Customs Inspector. But who really is Wolfgang? And what has he achieved?

A number of fringe figures have promoted conspiracy theories that doubt or dispute the events that took place that day - claiming, for example, that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U.S. Government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws. The most popular of these conspiracy theorists is the radio show host #AlexJones who, with his little friend Wolfgang Halbig, made a 30-minute video where they talk about the best evidence they have that the whole thing was a massive #Conspiracy.

In this video, I talk about the main pieces of 'evidence' the theorists give to support this theory, and talk about the horrendous impact these people are having on the families of the Sandy Hook victims.

Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
Founded 1744 by Muhammad bin Saud
Current head Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud
The House of Saud (Arabic: آل سعود‎ Āl Saʻūd) is the ruling royal family of Saudi Arabia. The family has thousands of members. It is composed of the descendants of Muhammad bin Saud and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.

The most influential member of the Royal family is the King of Saudi Arabia, currently King Salman. The throne was designed to pass from one son of the first king, Ibn Saud, to another. His deputy Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud is also from the ruling House of Saud, and the king-appointed cabinet includes more members of the royal family. While the monarchy is hereditary now, future Saudi kings will be chosen by a committee of Saudi princes, in line with a 2006 Royal Decree.[1]

The family is estimated to be composed of 15,000 members, but the majority of the power and wealth is possessed by a group of only about 2,000.[2][3]

The House of Saud has gone through three phases: the First Saudi State, the Second Saudi State, and the modern nation of Saudi Arabia. The First Saudi State marked the expansion of Wahhabism. The Second Saudi State was marked with continuous infighting. Modern Saudi Arabia wields considerable influence in the Middle East. The family has had conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, the Sharif of Mecca, the Al Rashid family of..

The tribe really does exist and not all that far from us - our next-door neighbours, really. Nevertheless, it'll take a major expedition to find them. They're called the Korowai and they live just as they did 10,000 years ago, deep in the jungles of West Papua.

The groundbreaking short films for the Thriller album, starting with ""Billie Jean,"" following up with ""Beat It"" and culminating with the epic, nearly 14-minute ""Thriller,"" truly expanded the possibilities of ""music video"" as art form. ""I wanted something that would glue you to the set, something you'd want to watch over and over,"" Michael wrote in his 1988 memoir Moonwalk. ""I wanted to be a pioneer in this relatively new medium and make the best short music movies we could make.""

In the short film's extended prologue, Michael's moonlit date with his girlfriend (played by model Ola Ray) is interrupted by his sudden transformation into a howling werewolf. While the ""real"" Michael and Ola, observing the scene in a movie theater, walk home from the their date, Michael teases her by singing the verses of ""Thriller.""

911,"9:11 Magazine. 911 and the tides, R Group & more by Porsche 3 days ago 9 minutes, 30 seconds 9,709 views","Episode 12 of 9:11 Magazine: 911 and the tides / Ear to the ground / R Group / Stuck’s star turn / Wet and wild in Spa

9:11 Magazine Episode 12: Extraordinary excursion with the new 911: through the French Atlantic; Porsche Wet Mode in detail; Rebels in the rain: the R Group; Le Mans 1987: the starred helmet of Hans-Joachim Stuck; WEC: wild ride to clinch the title early. Five stories and personalities around the theme of “Wet Mode”.

Chapter 1–The new 911 on an exceptional excursion [00:20]
It’s only passable for four hours a day—driving along the Passage du Gois in France is inextricably linked with the ebb and flow of the tide. The waters of the Atlantic Ocean can rise to a depth of up to 3 meters on the road. People are subject to the ebb and flow of life—and the Porsche 911 is no different.

Chapter 2—Porsche Wet Mode: Greater safety in the 911 [02:17]
Maximum safety when rain hits the road—offered by Porsche Wet Mode in the new 911. Acoustic sensors in the wheel wells of the iconic sports car “hear” spray thrown up by the tires. A message on the display recommends that the driver use the assistance system—even if the showers are over but the road is still wet. That means no restriction in power, but greater stability and a typical Porsche feeling.

Chapter 3—R Group: the craziest clique in the USA [03:33]
If you drive a historical Porsche in rough wind and weather, you can only be a member of the R Gruppe. Its main rule is “there are no rules.” Many people want to join, but not every Porsche enthusiast can become a member. “The R Gruppe is a close-knit group. Everyone has to be active. If you don’t join in, you’re out,” says founder Cris Huergas. The welded bonds of the R Gruppe last for lifetimes.

Chapter 4—Magical rainy night in Le Mans [05:38]
A monochrome blue helmet was too commonplace for Hans-Joachim Stuck before his first race as a factory driver in 1971. So his girlfriend cut white stars from foil and glued them onto his helmet. They promptly became the Bavarian driver’s trademark. Also at Le Mans in 1987 
in the victorious Porsche 962 C. Stuck’s magnificent performance on that rainy night laid the groundwork for the Porsche to win the race.

Chapter 5—Successful amid chaotic weather in Spa [07:11]
Buckets of rain, then snow—unfazed by the chaotic weather in Belgium’s Ardennes, Porsche clinches the GT title early in the World Endurance Championship at Spa-Francorchamps. Third and eighth place for the two Porsche 911 RSRs are enough to secure the title: Going into the grand finale, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the team can no longer be dislodged from the top spot in the manufacturers’ classification.

Susan Spencer talks with spy novelist Gayle Lynds and psychologist Rob Brotherton about humans' propensity to seek out clandestine, nefarious plots, and with professor Joseph Uscinski, who has studied hundreds of bizarre theories, and who thinks a little dose of conspiracy-thinking actually may be good for democracy.

We explain one of the most talked about conspiracy theories of all time. #Apollo11 #MoonLanding #ConspiracyTheory 

Stunning photos from the Apollo 11 mission are still coming out almost 50 years after a person first walked on the moon. 

Michael Collins, who was the Command Module pilot during the historic flight, shared what he says is a previously unreleased photo of the three astronauts in the crew.

""The crew. Found this at the bottom of a box. Don’t think it was ever used by @NASA. #TBT @TheRealBuzz,"" Collins tweeted Thursday with the ""Throwback Thursday"" hashtag. 

The photo shows Collins standing against a moon replica. Astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are photographed on the other side of the moon, with Armstrong's hand on Aldrin's shoulder.

Matt Landman - Creator https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4fttWX2A2PQ5nOHUV6dyQ

FrankenSkies is an 80 minute social change documentary regarding the Solar Geoengineering/Chem-trail agenda that affects every living being on earth. The struggle of bringing awareness to this subject, despite the obstacles of a socially engineered populace and the military industrial complex with its endless resources, is palpable in this awakening truth feature.

An impeccably timed eye opening expose, the film reveals the campaign to normalize chemical cloud formations via atmospheric aerosol dispersal's. Up against a normalization timetable encompassing a controlled media and an indoctrinated educational and political system, activists ask the question : Is your silence your consent?

A shocking informative film on climate engineering, frequency control and CIA manipulation, the film's narrative unfolds through a historical timeline of experimentation on humanity, bringing us to a modern day laboratory that encompasses the air we breath and dictates when and where the sun shall shine, or not...

In this video, we take a look at why our old system of measures has held out for so long, why Americans are so hesitant to make the switch, and most importantly, how metric might already be here to stay.

https://skl.sh/mustard7 

In the 1960’s, Britain's railways were in decline. The country’s railways were slow and antiquated and facing fierce competition against growing automobile ownership and booming air travel. But elsewhere in the world, railways were beginning to make a comeback, and the key seemed to be much higher speeds. Japan’s new high speed Shinkansen Bullet Trains proved enormously successful with passengers, carrying over 100 million passengers in just the first three years of service. The French had also begun working on a revolutionary new high train, the TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, ""high-speed train""). If British Rail was going to compete with automobiles and airliners, the solution seemed clear: much faster trains.

But elsewhere in the world high speed trains were developed along with new special dedicate high speed tracks. These new lines were constructed with long, straight sections of rail and gentle curves. For their Bullet Trains, the Japanese built an entirely new dedicated high-speed rail line (Tokaido Shinkansen). For their TGV, the French would need to build hundreds of kilometers of dedicated high speed track (LGV for Ligne à Grande Vitesse).

But the British would take a different approach. Instead of spending billions on new high-speed rail infrastructure, they would engineer a new kind of high speed train that could run on Britain’s existing rail network. The challenge was that many of Britain’s railways were built a hundred years earlier, and they were full of sharp twists and turns. The solution, was to engineer a train that would lean into bends like a motorcycle, maintaining passenger comfort even while running a high speeds around sharp curves. With active tilting technology, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), would be able to bend nearly twice as fast as any British train. During testing in 1979, the APT hit 261 km/h, setting a new British speed record.

But the APT’s development was plagued by setbacks and delays. The train never lived up to its potential. From day one, the APT was plagued by technical problems; everything from frozen breaks to failed tilting mechanisms. Nearly a third of passengers to become motion sick from the tilting mechanism. After a disastrous debut, British Rail faced an uphill battle to overcome technical challenges and win back public confidence in their innovative train. It was a battle they would never win.

Sorry about the autofocus (we disabled it in later talks). Me running around on stage didn't help. As always, send complaints to Steve.

This was one of nine ""Tiny Talks"" given over three days at the meetup. Every year, employees submit Tiny Talk ideas on a wide range of topics (some completely random and not company-related at all, like this one) and we vote on which ones we want to hear. So, thank you to my coworkers for voting me in.

Original proposal description I submitted for this talk:

Let's say you're traveling at about 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 km/h) in low earth orbit, your main engines are out of fuel, and it's your job to guide the spaceship through a fiery re-entry without burning up or skipping out of the atmosphere, navigate to your landing site, and arrive with just enough energy to make an unpowered landing on a runway which is halfway around the planet from where you started. And, of course, either you succeed on your first try, or everyone dies. So, no pressure…. In this talk, I'll show you how space shuttle designers, pilots, and autopilots managed to do just that.

Dear friends and followers, welcome back to my channel and to a great video about the famous BLACK BOX or Flight Data Recorder. 

So what is this black box they always seem to be looking for?
The black box is very often split into two black boxes which will help the investigators to determine what and how it led to the accident. 
Each box weighs roughly twenty-pound and each has the size of a shoebox.
One of them is the CVR, cockpit voice recorder. Picture a classic tape recorder with four microphone cables attached to it. One leading into the radio control panels, to record any communication between the pilots and the air traffic controllers. One recording all conversation via the intercom within the cockpit and another one leading to the overhead panel microphone, recording ambient sounds of the cockpit such as engines and aural warnings. 

When does it, and how much does it record? 
It automatically starts recording if in flight and on ground when at least one engine is running and for a few minutes after the last engine was shut down. But on most planes, you have to the option to manually start CVR by pressing a button on its respective panel. 

The CVR records the last two hours of crew conversation and communication with ATC. So whenever you arrive at the gate and shut down the engines you could listen to the last two hours of conversation. You can´t within in the cockpit, you would have to detach the recorder from its housing and place into a special docking station to listen to it.
Funny enough Airbus and Boeing models have a ""CVR Erase"" button, once you press that, all latest recordings get erased. 

The other recorder or second black box is the flight data recorder. 
The Flight Data Recorder, also known as ADR, the accident data recorder records data at a much larger scale. 
Now the FAA regulates, that the FDR must monitor at least eighty-eight important parameters such altitude, airspeed, heading, aircraft attitude for a minimum of 25 hours. 
Nowadays, FDRs made by Honeywell, for instance, can record up to 1000 in-flight parameters and characteristics such as flap position, auto-pilot modes, weather radar readouts and much much more to aid the investigators. This then allows the retrieved data from the FDR to generate a computer-animated video, reconstructing the flight before and during the crash. Which can look similar to this animation. 
So the combination of the visual part by the FDR and the audio by the CVR enables a realistic picture for the investigators. So With the collected data from both recorders, the investigators determine whether an accident was caused by pilot error, by an external event (such as wind shear), or airplane technical failures.

But see more within the video ... 

Thank you very much for your time! I hope you enjoy this video!
Wishing you all the best!

The relentless noise and vibration from a piston powered propeller aircraft often made long flights even more exhausting. Most aircraft also couldn’t fly high enough to avoid bad weather, so air sickness was more common. 

After World War Two, as part of an effort to develop its civil aviation industry, Britain stunned the world by unveiling the world's jet airliner. The de Havilland Comet was sleek, quiet, and flew higher and faster than any airliner of the day. As piston propeller technology was reaching its limits, the conventional thinking was that jet engines were too unreliable and produced too little power relative to their fuel consumption. But the de Havilland Comet proved that jet travel was the future. When the Comet entered service in 1952, it immediately began breaking travel time records and became a point of national pride for Britain. 

The de Havilland Comet was perhaps little too ahead of it’s time. With such a clean sheet design, there will still lessons to learn. When early Comets suffered from catastrophic depressurization incidents, the entire fleet was grounded and their Certificate of Airworthiness was revoked. Flaws in the design of the aircraft’s fuselage were resolved in later Comet versions. However, the rest of the world was now catching up, and manufacturers including Boeing and Douglas began to offer their own jet airliners. While later version Comets served airlines reliably, they were outsold by competing aircraft. There's no question However, that the comet paved the way.

chemtrails,"What if GREENLAND Melted? by Atlas Pro 2 days ago 8 minutes, 26 seconds 196,045 views","Isostatic rebound isn't expected to be too great over Greenland, and instead is greatest over parts of Canada, Scandinavia, and Antarctica, so I didn't include it. Also whatever rebound occurred would likely be offset by Antarctica's continued melting.

At 20 years young, Grandmaster Robert James Fischer was already among the world's very best chess players. In this brilliancy, Fischer demonstrates how to inject multiple imbalances into a highly symmetrical position, how to properly highlight these differences to benefit oneself, and how to accurately assess the true value of the pieces as they rest on the board.

▶▶SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/SidRothYouTube

Laurie Ditto says God allowed her to experience the sure realities of Hell because satan wants people to think…otherwise.

Laurie Ditto’s visions of Heaven and Hell were meant as a wake-up call for us all! Laurie’s unplanned but vibrant glimpses of Heaven put her life in sudden focus. Today she shares from her Kingdom experiences and shows how Life in Heaven is THE model for believers on earth. Laurie says “Thy Kingdom come” has both purpose and power. Pursue it with expectation!

But God had something more for Laurie, including a round trip journey to Hell and back. Her assignment is to tell you what you don’t want to hear — she saw relatives and believers in torment. Laurie even understood her own stubborn unforgiveness was enough to cost her for eternity. Laurie says there is an afterlife you NEVER want to experience, including:

• Five pains of Hell: water, bone marrow, breath, agreement and the garment
• Demons and their activities
• A sobering connection between unforgiveness and eternal torment
• The ultimate fate of those condemned
• How people’s bodies are changed in Hell

Laurie’s book, The Hell Conspiracy, relates to her very real salvation in Jesus, and yours! Her exclusive 3-CD set, Heaven Encounters, is enough to make you want to get there.

Laurie Ditto ministers through her testimonies of Heaven and Hell and serves as director of My Father’s Reputation. She and her husband Mike have two daughters and eleven grandchildren.

Often called stellar nurseries, nebulae are the birthplace of stars. They are made up of mostly hydrogen but also contain other matter like gases, dust, ice and rock. The gravity of the nebula pulls this matter into the centre, and the nebula experiences a gravitational collapse.

In the city of Seattle, Washington there exists a vending machine that over the years has become something of a local landmark amongst residents who are familiar with its mysterious history. Situated on the corner the John Street and 10th Avenue East in the bustling Capitol Hill neighbourhood, the seemingly ancient machine is well known for dispensing random, sometimes rare, cans of soda- a fact that’s made all the more intriguing when you consider that nobody seems to know who stocks the machine or where it came from.

chemtrails,"Why are these 32 symbols found in caves all over Europe | Genevieve von Petzinger by TED 3 years ago 12 minutes 4,118,063 views","Written language, the hallmark of human civilization, didn't just suddenly appear one day. Thousands of years before the first fully developed writing systems, our ancestors scrawled geometric signs across the walls of the caves they sheltered in. Paleoanthropologist and rock art researcher Genevieve von Petzinger has studied and codified these ancient markings in caves across Europe. The uniformity of her findings suggest that graphic communication, and the ability to preserve and transmit messages beyond a single moment in time, may be much older than we think.

For ages I’ve been thinking about doing a video analyzing time travel in fiction and doing a comparison of different fictional time travels – some do use wormholes, some relativistic/faster than light travel with time dilation, some closed timelike curves, some have essentially “magic” or no consistent rules that make any sense, or TARDIS's, or whatever. This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows – not how it works “under the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters’ timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?). In particular, I explain Ender's Game, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Primer, Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Looper, the video game “Braid”, and Lifeline.

Homes have many uses. They can prove a bolthole to escape predators, a safe nursery in which to raise young, a food store and a shelter from bad weather. 
Animals of many shapes and sizes build their own homes. Perhaps the biggest construction projects are those undertaken by ants. Hundreds of thousands work together to construct their home. 
Small mammals are expert diggers. Meerkats and hamsters both excavate elaborate tunnels where they can stay out of harm's way and raise their young, though the hamster likes to work alone while the meerkats prefer to have the company of an entire clan. 
When it comes to making a nursery, it’s birds who steal the show. In just a few days they can construct a basket of twigs - a nest that can support their growing family and keep them out of harm's way.

“Following filmmaker Michael Moore's open letter to Ivanka Trump to convince her father, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, to end his campaign last week, the Oscar winner on Tuesday wrote an op-ed for The Huffington Post, stating that Trump is self-sabotaging his campaign.

""Donald Trump never actually wanted to be president of the United States,"" Moore wrote. ""I know this for a fact.""

He believes that, because Trump wasn't happy with his deal on his NBC show ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" he floated the idea that he'd run for president in the hopes of strengthening his hand in the negotiations.”

So called “chemtrails,” though more technically known as contrails, first appeared behind planes going all the way back to the earliest days of high altitude flight. One of the earliest known surviving references of such occurred when an American soldier by the name of Captain Ward Wells observed a peculiar sight in the heavens in October of 1918, with his letter written on the subject eventually being published in Scientific American.

This film devotes itself on the one hand to the bald eagle, the heraldic bird of the United States, and on the other, the Golden Eagle, Europe's largest predatory bird. Many bald eagles live in the Chilkoot State Park in Alaska's south. In fact, more than 400 pairs reside there for the entire year. With a wingspan of some 2.5 metres, they are amongst the largest of their species. The offspring have to leave the eyrie by September at the latest, as then, winter sets in. 

On clear, starry nights, one can experience the Northern Lights. There are certain places where especially many eagles group. 3000 to 4500 of them. Because, beneath the Chilkat ice blanket, chum salmon feel at home. The reason for this is the volcanic activity of the surrounding areas. Hot sources feed the different tributaries of the Chilkat. It is the fourth and final salmon migration of the year - nowhere else does this take place so late in the year.

This combination of ice-free water and spawning fish facilitates the survival of many young eagles through their first winter. In the Dolomites, we observe a Golden Eagle couple and their offspring. The strategy of hunter and hunted is impressively documented. For the very first time we experience a groundhog's fight for survival, attempting to flee the eagles' eyrie at a height of 2000 meters, despite the fact this means confrontation with the eagle's offspring. Golden Eagles have virtually conquered the entire northern hemisphere. But the future hunting grounds of the young eagles belongs to the most beautiful: the Dolomites - as majestic as the Kings of the skies.",Eagles - Hunters of the Sky,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmVP0dIgG6Y,5,,0,1720,768669,3395,256,0,205,772525

They kill with unbelievable precision. They fight Kung Fu style and are seen in Japan as a symbol of vigilance - the mantises. Their triangular head with its unique flexibility is conspicuous. Two overdimensioned eyes fixate the distance to their prey rapidly and three-dimensionally. The chest segment of the mantis is prolonged and equipped with spiny appendages that can spear their prey as fast as a jack knife. The mysterious aura that surrounds the praying mantis has a lot to do with the fact that they are rarely seen. They have adapted to their surroundings perfectly. No matter whether leaves, blossoms, tree bark, sandy floors or even orchids - the mantis adjusts to all environments. 

We observe mantises with our cameras whilst they are hunting, when they shed their skin and whilst breeding and eventually the females practicing their cannibalism. We were also on hand when the female produces a nest of foam on which to lay her eggs; all filmed with time lapse and real-time cameras. A film, that comprehensively documents the secret life of the mantises for the very first time and provides us with unique footage thanks to state of the art equipment.",Praying Mantises - The Kung Fu Killers of the Insect Kingdom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoEfjhgwliw,5,,0,1803,4186033,30244,6286,0,3797,4226360

—————————————————————————————————— 

Today´s topic will be all about Flex Temperature, what is good for and how often do we use it. 
Prior to every take-off you need to perform take-off calculations, giving you the speed V1, VR, and V2 and they necessary flex temperature to get the needed thrust setting for the take-off roll and lift off and eventually first climb out. 
The flex temperature is a assumed outside air temperature, relatively high, forcing the FADEC ( Full Authority Digital Engine Control)-unit to reduce the thrust output to reduce the engine wear of the turbine in such expected ""hot"" temperatures. So once applying take-off thrust by setting the thrust levers to the FLX/MCT detent, the airplane will roll down the runway with a lower power setting thus increasing the take-off with higher speeds and decreasing the stop margin available. But you can always gain full available power by putting the levers into the TOGA detent position. 
The result of using a high flex temperature is that is the speeds are higher for lift-off, cause the plane won´t accelerate as quickly as it could and therefore using up more runway, resulting in a shorter stop distance and case of a rejected take-off, obviously! 
If we would have used a lower flex temperature, the lift-off speed is much lower and the stop distance is much greater compared to the higher flex temperature.

So the conclusion of that is, the lower the flex temperature, so the fake outside air temperature for the FADEC, the more power will be set when applying thrust, so the closer it is to TOGA. The higher the flex temperature the more the engine is derated resulting in longer take-off roll with higher speeds and at the same time reducing the engine wear.

The Southwest Wildlife Foundation of Utah has released a short film titled, ""The Bald Eagle That Would Not Quit"".  In January of 2015, a very, very, sick bald eagle arrived at the rescue center.  Initially, wildlife rehabilitator, Martin Tyner, did not think the bird would survive.  Over nearly two months, the bald eagle continued to fight and, against all odds, grew stronger and healthier.

This film features footage of examinations and feedings as the bald eagle recovers. During sessions with the bald eagle, Martin shares extensive information about wildlife rehabilitation and notes positive signs of recovery.

Educational materials and  full transcript are available at http://www.gowildlife.org

At age nineteen, Tyner was hired as curator of birds of prey at Busch Gardens, CA.  Martin Tyner is a federally licensed falconer, eagle falconer, wildlife rehabilitator, wildlife propagator, and wildlife and environmental educator. He has been providing wildlife and environmental programs throughout the western United States to schools, scouts and community groups for over forty years.

A case that has turned the heads of even some of the most ardent of sceptics, we recount the tales from Skinwalker Ranch.

This work is a condensed retelling of the events depicted in the excellent book ‘Hunt for the Skinwalker’ by Colm Kelleher and George Knapp. For a more detailed insight into the phenomena that took place at Skinwalker Ranch, we wholeheartedly recommend purchasing that book.

flatearth,"The Perfect Cosmological Principle | Return of the Steady State Universe by gavinwince 4 years ago 2 hours, 46 minutes 1,479,614 views","According to modern cosmology, the Steady State model of the universe, an alternative to the Big Bang theory, is now obsolete. Yet, modern cosmology faces devastating blows to Big Bang cosmology. ""Dark matter"" weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS) have not been detected. Super-symmetry particles have also not be detected. The recent observation (BICEP2) of gravitational waves in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) has been discredited. The absence of these discoveries is a devastating blow to modern cosmology placing it on shaky ground. As the Big Bang and Inflation theory begin to lose their luster, the return to a steady state theory of the universe seems inevitable.

We’ve been exploring the idea of three-dimensional time and applying it to physics. Multidimensional time isn’t a new idea by any stretch. Yet, a unique way of deriving three-dimensional time emerges from a set of simple and peculiar equations. Let’s suspend everything we know about time for a moment and open up our imagination. The concepts of ordinary time and time dilation found in physics have equivalences with our use of multidimensional time and are easily accounted for. These equivalences gives rise to temporal mechanics, a new approach to the concept of mass and how it relates to energy and conservation laws. Can multidimensional time be used to solve the unresolved problems in physics?

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

A disaster is looming.  A fabulous city, rich in culture, and technological advances, is about to be destroyed.  Buildings, people, an entire civilisation, swept away by an overwhelming natural disaster.  The legend has entranced scientists and scholars for centuries.

In this episode Naked Science goes in search of the most enduring myth of all - The City of Atlantis - lost beneath the waves to a massive natural cataclysm some 11,000 years ago.  We know very little of Atlantis, in fact were it not for the writings of the Greek philosopher Plato we might not have encountered it at all.  Plato, recounting a story he heard as a child, described a huge metropolis, rich in fine art, architecture and culture.  The city was destroyed in the space of a day and a night, sunk beneath the waves for eternity by a massive natural cataclysm.  For thousands of years the tale remained an obscure yet tantalising fable until an American by the name of Ignatius Donnelly reignited the idea, bringing it to worldwide attention and sending archaeologists and trophy hunters alike across the globe in its wake.",Naked Science - Atlantis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqauNqFwt5I,5,,0,2998,1534520,5351,760,0,1746,1542377

In 100 trillion years the era of stars will be over.

We live in an unusual age – the age when the stars still shine. We should count ourselves lucky – nearly all of future history will be dark. But events will still unfold in that long, cooling darkness, and civilizations may endure. So how will the universe and its far-future denizens spend eternity?

In 100 trillion years the last star in the universe will expand the final atoms of its hydrogen fuel and settle quietly into a dim white dwarf, before slowly fading to black over as it radiates away its remnant heat. The era of stars will be over. That 100 trillion years is 10,000 times the current age of the universe, and so the days of starlight and warmth have a way to go. But even when they are done, the universe will be young in comparison to the long, dark ages to follow. In fact our universe will spend almost all of its infinite time in darkness, slowly crawling towards maximum entropy and ultimate heat death.

Energy too cheap to meter - that was the promise of nuclear power in the 1950s, at least according to Lewis Strauss chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. That promise has not come to pass - but with some incredible new technologies, perhaps it still could. The question is - should it?

Hosted by Matt O'Dowd
Written by Matt O'Dowd

Directed by Andrew Kornhaber
Produced By: Kornhaber Brown

If we want to convert mass into energy, fission gives the most bang for our buck. Unfortunately that “bang” can be literal. Use of nuclear energy may risk the proliferation of nuclear weaponry, and there’s also the problem of nuclear waste, and the specter of horrible accidents. This last one was painted in terrifying detail in the recent dramatization of the Chernobyl disaster. Nuclear reactors sound scary because the disasters are pretty epic. However the reality is that far, far more people die from straight up air pollution due to coal-fired power plants than ever died in a nuclear reactor accident. In fact the radioactivity around coal-fired plants is also higher due to the trace but completely uncontained radioactive products of coal burning.
 
But the most compelling attraction is that nuclear power doesn’t directly produce carbon emissions. In fact nuclear power may be our most sure path to reducing carbon emissions and halting climate change. But can we do nuclear power safely enough? There are modern ideas – including the much-hyped thorium reactor – that suggest maybe we can. Before we can understand those we’ll need to review how nuclear reactors work.

At the above link, you can download 3D-print files to make some of the objects in the video, plus learn more about compliant mechanisms.

What I learned about compliant mechanisms I summarize in the 8 P's of compliant mechanisms:

1. Part count (reduced by having flexible parts instead of springs, hinges)
2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)
3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)
4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)
5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)
6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)
7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)
8. Predictability (devices are reliable over a long period of time)

6:10 - Rocket engine cycles 
20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison
30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines
44:05 - Summary

Article version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823&preview=true

SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! 

Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.

And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.

We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.

So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…

Source: https://matrixdisclosure.com/

Since the dawn of man, the time has been his ruthless enemy. There was nothing man could do to escape his earthly demise.

But the pyramids towering over man and his creations fear no time.

Much has been said about the origins of these mysterious structures, so much that the truth has been concealed within piles of false assumptions.

But an archaic figure has cracked the riddle of both time and pyramid.

His name is Enoch – the man who cheated death to go rule over the otherworldly kingdom of a higher force.

Before departing for these higher beings, Enoch had left a luxuriant cultural heritage for the generations to come.

He wished for them to solve the riddle of time, just like him, so he concealed the answers within his teachings, and within the greatest architectural mystery of present-day – The Great Pyramid of Egypt.

Sumerian and Mayan accounts remind of Enoch as the one who conquered time and who encoded this secret within the time-defying pyramids – his masterpiece.

It is now up to YOU to decipher this timeworn knowledge and garner its unimaginable benefits.

Anunnaki is believed to be a group of deities in several ancient Mesopotamian cultures such as the Babylonian, Sumerian, Assyrian, and Akkadian.

The name Anunnaki is a derivative of the names heaven “Anu”, and earth “Ki”. However, some groups translate them as “princely offspring” or “Those of Royal Blood”.

The Sumerian legends and the ancient texts use the word Annunaki to refer to a group of gods who came from heaven.

They were considered as the main gods of the Sumerian pantheon. The Sumerians worshipped these gods long before the great pantheon of ancient Greece and before the ancient Egyptian gods.

The Anunnaki descended from An, the supreme being that reigned over all the Sumerian gods.

The Babylonian myths of creation say there were 300 Anunnaki who kept the heavens and 300 others who guarded the underworld.

These deities were so important that they were also mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh.

The development of Sumerian civilization occurred in the Persian Gulf while growing to strength over time.

The “Plain of the Land of Shinar” is the territory that was renamed to Babylon after 2000 B.C.

These people lived in the Middle East on the territory we know as Iran and Iraq today.","Enoch, Great Pyramid of Egypt, and the Anunnaki Civilization Saga",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj7pM28Yuyo,5,,0,1493,956820,7773,998,0,1712,967303

What is Minecraft? Minecraft is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on Minecraft is designed and constructed by members of the community. Minecraft is designed for 8 to 18 year old, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore Minecraft — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet ­to ­be ­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, Minecraft members can earn speciality badges as well as Minecraft dollars (“Minecraft”). In turn, they can shop the online catalogue to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",Minecraft EVIL MOON APPEARS IN OUR HOUSE IN MINECRAFT / DEFEND THE ZOMBIE FAMILY !!

moonlanding,Origin of the Solar System - First Stars - Space Discovery Documentary by How the Universe Works 1 hour ago 537 views,"One of the most-asked questions of astronomers is: how did our Sun and planets get here? It's a good question and one that researchers are answering as they explore the solar system. There has been no shortage of theories about the birth of the planets over the years. This is not surprising considering that for centuries the Earth was believed to be the center of the entire universe, not to mention our solar system. Naturally, this led to a misevaluation of our origins. Some early theories suggested that the planets were spat out of the Sun and solidified. Others, less scientific, suggested that some deity simply created the solar system out of nothing in just a few ""days"". The truth, however, is far more exciting and is still a story being filled out with observational data. 


As our understanding of our place in the galaxy has grown, we have re-evaluated the question of our beginnings. But in order to identify the true origin of the solar system, we must first identify the conditions that such a theory would have to meet.",Origin of the Solar System - First Stars - Space Discovery Documentary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y77deK6vJz8,5,,0,0,86065,420,79,0,0,86564

The technological means to cross space and perhaps bring this small world back to life is just now coming within our grasp. Settlers beware: Mars is likely to change Humanity as much as we change it.

moonlanding,"How Large is the Universe? by SpaceRip 6 years ago 25 minutes 3,959,018 views","The universe has long captivated us with its immense scales of distance and time. How far does it stretch? Where does it end, and what lies beyond its star fields and streams of galaxies extending as far as telescopes can see?

These questions are beginning to yield to a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation and technologies that are letting us to peer into the most distant realms of the cosmos. But also at the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest of scales. Remarkably, our growing understanding of this kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei of atoms, permits us to glimpse the largest vistas of space and time.  In ancient times, most observers saw the stars as a sphere surrounding the earth, often the home of deities. The Greeks were the first to see celestial events as phenomena, subject to human investigation rather than the fickle whims of the Gods. 

One sky-watcher, for example, suggested that meteors are made of materials found on Earth... and might have even come from the Earth. Those early astronomers built the foundations of modern science. But they would be shocked to see the discoveries made by their counterparts today. The stars and planets that once harbored the gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of a vast scaffolding of matter and energy extending far out into space. 

Just how far began to emerge in the 1920s. Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope on California's Mt. Wilson,  astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with his assistant named Milt Humason, analyzed the light of fuzzy patches of sky... known then as nebulae. 

They showed that these were actually distant galaxies far beyond our own. Hubble and Humason discovered that most of them are moving away from us. The farther out they looked, the faster they were receding. This fact, now known as Hubble's law, suggests that there must have been a time when the matter in all these galaxies was together in one place. 

That time, when our universe sprung forth, has come to be called the Big Bang. How large the cosmos has gotten since then depends on how long its been growing and its expansion rate. Recent precision measurements gathered by the Hubble space telescope and other instruments have brought a consensus... 

That the universe dates back 13.7 billion years. Its radius, then, is the distance a beam of light would have traveled in that time ... 13.7 billion light years. That works out to about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers. In fact, it's even bigger.... Much bigger. How it got so large, so fast, was until recently a deep mystery.

That the universe could expand had been predicted back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that Einstein himself didn't believe it until he saw Hubble and Humason's evidence. Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that galaxies could be moving apart because space itself is expanding. 

So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant star, it moves through a cosmic landscape that is getting larger and larger, increasing the distance it must travel to reach us. In 1995, the orbiting telescope named for Edwin Hubble began to take the measure of the universe... by looking for the most distant galaxies it could see. 

Taking the expansion of the universe into account, the space telescope found galaxies that are now almost 46 billion light years away from us in each direction... and almost 92 billion light years from each other. And that would be the whole universe... according to a straightforward model of the big bang. But remarkably, that might be a mere speck within the universe as a whole, according to a dramatic new theory that describes the origins of the cosmos.

Of course, launching a rocket powered by radioactive material has its own risks as well. Should we attempt it?

moonlanding,"Top 10 Improvised Scenes in Movie History by CineFix 4 years ago 9 minutes, 34 seconds 3,949,989 views","While we appreciate a good script, some of the greatest moments in movies come from when talented actors are given the leeway to go off-book. Here are 10 of the greatest scenes born of improvisation in movie history. Subscribe: http://goo.gl/9AGRm

What did you think of the list? Do you agree with our selections, or do you think some of our picks are overrated. Do you think we snubbed some of your favorite improvised scenes in our list? Do you have a favorite scene from the work of Robin Williams or Bill Murray?

Let us know in the comments!

THE LIST

Bridesmaids (2011)
A lot of this movie was the talented comedic actresses in the cast going off book, but Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone’s “Air Marshall” exchange takes the cake.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Marlon Brando’s performance as Col Kurtz was largely made up on the spot. And while we don’t endorse actors not learning their lines, we can’t fault what came of it in this instance…

Iron Man (2008)
Robert Downey, Jr surprised everyone in his comeback performance as Tony Stark. Everyone - because most of what he said wasn’t in the script.

The Jazz Singer (1927)
Al Jolson’s improvised dialogue pretty much invented the entire concept of talking in movies. Think about that.

Caddyshack (1980)
Bill Murray’s been giving improvised performances his whole career, but his hilarious ad libbed “Cinderella Story” on the golf course made Caddyshack the movie it is today.

Goodfellas (1990)
The “Funny How?” exchange between Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta was a genius bit of collaboration between Joe Pesci and Martin Scorsese - and no one else in the scene.

The Breakfast Club (1985)
The climactic scene in which the teenagers finally bond over how they came to where they were was based entirely on the actors’ knowledge of the characters. And it worked.

This is Spinal Tap (1984)
It goes to 11. 

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
The home invasion scene never came together, until Malcolm McDowell was given reign to improvise on the next take. His brutal song-and-dance number makes this one of the most chilling scenes in movie history.

Robin Williams 
From “GOOOOD Morning Vietnam” to Night at the Museum, Robin Williams was master of improv, and his riffs enriched every role he ever inhabited. We’ll miss his unique voice for years to come.

Our friends over at IndieWire put together some seriously inspired MOVIE LISTS: http://bit.ly/12x0UpF and CineFix is bringing 'em to life!",Top 10 Improvised Scenes in Movie History,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNAajAflpBQ,5,,0,574,3971213,28228,1939,0,2879,4004259
moonlanding,"Top 10 Movie Shootouts of All Time by CineFix 4 years ago 15 minutes 1,751,707 views","Gunfights have been a cornerstone of movie action for as long as there have been prop guns. Whether it’s an over-the-top bloodbath or a tension-filled sharpshot, gunfights add a serious dose of awesome to any film. Subscribe: http://goo.gl/9AGRm

What did you think of the list? Do you agree with our selections of the best movie shootouts of all time? Do you have a favorite gun fight we left off the list? Which genre do you think produces the best shootouts - Western, Action-thriller, Crime Drama? What other movie lists would you like to see here on CineFix in the future?  

Let us know in the comments!

THE LIST
 
Desperado (1995)
Director: Robert Rodiguez
The bar shootout in Desparado was the defining moment in a film the defined Robert Rodriguez as a filmmaker.

State of Grace (1990)
Director: Phil Joanou
The final shootout in this lesser-known mob movie is our favorite mob shoot up of all time. 

The Matrix (1999)
Directors: Andy and Lana Wachowski
The lobby shootout in the original Matrix film is not only a great shootout, it’s a beautiful intersection of action and effects. 

The Killer (1989)
Director: John Woo
Director John Woo is famous for his amazing gunfight sequences (and his use of birds) but the final Church Shootout from The Killer is our absolute favorite of his work. 

The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966)
Director: Sergio Leone
Proving that a great shootout doesn’t need to include an absolute hail of bullets, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly manages to ramp up the tension with a mere 2 bullets (along with some amazing cinematography and music)

No Country for Old Men (2007)
Director: The Coen Brothers
The Coen Brothers are masters of their own style of violence, and nowhere is that more apparent than the cat-and-mouse gun battle between Anton Chigurh and Llewelyn.

Scarface (1983)
Director: Brian De Palma
Come on, is there anything more iconic than being told thy Tony Montana’s “Say Hello to my little friend!”?

The Wild Bunch (1969)
Director: Sam Peckinpah
The use of slow-motion and complicated editing in The Wild Bunch was the genesis of a lot of Western showdowns for years to come.

Heat (1995)
Director: Michael Mann
The face-off between Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in the robbery sequence is notable if only for the stars appearing in it… but the visceral reality of this sequence is what earns it our top spot.",Top 10 Movie Shootouts of All Time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIJ3NKHfi4U,5,,0,932,1754168,15498,745,0,3317,1773728

These included an image from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager or (LORRI) – looking back at Pluto – hours after the historic flyby that shows haze in the planet’s sunlit atmosphere, that extends as high as 80 miles above Pluto’s surface – much higher than expected. Models suggest that the hazes form when ultraviolet sunlight breaks apart methane gas.
 
LORRI images also show evidence that exotic ices have flowed – and may still be flowing across Pluto’s surface, similar to glacial movement on Earth. This unpredicted sign of present-day geologic activity was detected in Sputnik Planum – an area in the western part of Pluto’s heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio.

As brave space explorers, astronauts have to tolerate their bones weakening and their eyes changing but no one expected they would see ghostly lights or hear otherworldly music in space. Even stranger is the chilling stories of exploding objects, space eels, and strange spacecraft caught on NASA footage. These NASA secrets are just as weird as the things astronauts did on purpose, like bringing contagious bacteria into space and turning it into super bacteria or lighting a fire to see what burned. Of course, who can forget the strange UFOs caught on camera in space. See all these and more in this video of 25 strange things that have happened in space.

moonlanding,"Saturn's Mysterious Moons by SpaceRip 8 years ago 25 minutes 724,030 views","Launched three years before the new century... a spacecraft wound its way through the empty reaches of the solar system. On Earth, its progress was little noted, as it swung twice by the planet Venus, then our moon. And Earth. The asteroid belt. And Jupiter.

Almost seven years later, on the first of July 2004, the Cassini probe entered the orbit of Saturn. It then began to compile what has become one of the greatest photographic collections of all time, of a giant gas planet, surrounded by colorful rings, guarded by a diverse collection of moons, and millions of tiny moonlets. 

Within this record, is a trail of clues... pointing to the energy sources and complex chemistry needed to spawn life. What are these mysterious worlds telling us about the universe, and Earth? 

In the outer reaches of the solar system, a billion and a half kilometers from the Sun... there is a little world known as Enceladus. Nearly all of the sunlight that strikes its icy surface is reflected back into space, making it one of the brightest objects in the solar system.

At its equator, the average temperature is minus 198 degrees Celsius. It can rise about 70 degrees higher in grooves that stretch across the south pole like tiger stripes.  Looming over it is the giant planet Saturn.

In myth, Saturn - the Roman name for the primal Greek God Chronos - was the youngest son of Gaia, or Earth, and Uranus, sky. Wielding a scythe provided by his mother, the story goes, Saturn confronted his abusive father, castrating him. The blood of Uranus flowed into the seas, fertilizing the Earth and giving rise to Enceladus and other giant offspring. 

Saturn's moon Enceladus has its own tangled story. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft spotted plumes of water vapor shooting out into space from its south pole. 

More recent close encounters have revealed jets of water, flavored by slightly salty chemical compounds, spewing out from vents in the rough, cracked polar terrain. That may mean that Enceladus harbors a remarkable secret below its frigid surface: A liquid ocean, and perhaps, a chemical environment that could spawn simple life forms. 

It's not the only promising stop in the realm of Saturn. The moon Titan is often said to resemble Earth in its early days. It is lined with volcanoes and a hazy atmosphere rich in organic compounds. 

While Enceladus is the size of Great Britain, Titan is ten times larger, 50% larger than our moon, and the second largest moon in our solar system.

We've known about Titan since the astronomer Christian Huygens discovered it in 1655, and Enceladus since William Herschel spotted it in August 1789, just after the start of the French Revolution. 

Scientists began to investigate these moons in earnest with the launch of the two Voyager spacecraft in 1977.  The lineup of outer planets in the solar system allowed the spacecraft to fly past each of them.

They disclosed new details about their magnetic fields, atmospheres, ring systems, and inner cores. But what really turned heads were the varied shapes and surfaces of their moons. 

They've all been pummeled over the millennia by wayward asteroids and comets. A few appear to be sculpted by forces below their surfaces. Neptune's largest moon Triton has few craters. It's marked with circular depressions bounded by rugged ridges. There are also grooves and folds that stretch for dozens of miles, a sign of fracturing and deforming. 

Triton has geysers too, shooting some five miles above the surface. But on this frigid moon -- so far from the Sun -- the liquid that spouts is not water but nitrogen. 

Tiny Miranda, one of 27 known moons that orbit Uranus, wears a jumbled skin that's been shaped and reshaped by forces within. Jupiter's moon Io -- orbiting perilously close to the giant planet is literally turning itself inside out. Rivers of lava roll down from open craters that erupt like fountains.
 
Flying by Europa, Voyager documented a complex network of criss-crossing grooves and ridges. In the 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft went back to get a closer look. It found that Europa's surface is a crazy quilt of fractured plates, cliff faces and gullies... amid long grooves like a network of superhighways. How did it get like this? 

Then, heat rising up through a subsurface ocean of liquid water cracks,  and shifts, and spreads the icy surface in a thousand different ways. Europa's neighbors, Callisto and Ganymede, show similar features, suggesting they too may have liquid oceans below their surfaces.
 
Crossing outward to Saturn, Voyager found a similar surface on the moon Enceladus. So when the Cassini spacecraft arrived in 2004, it came looking for answers to a range of burning questions: if this moon and others have subsurface oceans? Do they also have the ability to cook up and support life? And what could they tell us about the origin of life throughout the galaxy?",Saturn's Mysterious Moons,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL__UbPsPDg,5,,0,1515,740560,4480,225,0,885,746150

As far as we know this is the end of not only life as we know it but everything that’s ever existed. No more matter, no more light, no more particles, no more nothing. It’s a harrowing reality to fathom, but it’s one we need not worry about too much – if the universe does end, it will be in an unfathomable amount of time as it eclipses trillions upon trillions of years.

But the case is far from clear: O’Brien’s team maintains they wrote the bits and that the plaintiff lacks evidence.

The case highlights how difficult it is to own a joke legally, and to prove it’s been stolen. Comedian Patton Oswalt is a witness in the case and can’t address it directly.

VICE News spoke with Oswalt about joke-stealing, and where the line is.

vaccines,"Jimmy Kimmel Demonstrates Why Denying Gay Couples Wedding Cakes is Wrong by Jimmy Kimmel Live 1 year ago 3 minutes, 58 seconds 1,234,509 views","A controversial decision came from a court in Kern County, California that ruled in favor of a bakery that refused to make a cake for a same sex wedding because the owner said it would violate her Christian faith. This isn't the first instance of a bakery refusing to make a cake for a same sex wedding, there's a case right now in the Supreme Court, but the judge's ruling in this particular case is interesting. He says the bakery would have violated the law if it refused to sell the gay couple a cake that was already baked, but that they can't be forced to bake one. So Jimmy uses a common restaurant dining experience to explain why this isn't right.

Pastor Rick Warren teaches seven ways to test your ideas, impressions, and thoughts to know with absolute certainty you are hearing the voice of God. Ask yourself these questions: Does it agree with the bible? Does it make me more like Christ? Does my church family confirm it? Is it consistent with how God shaped me? Does it concern my responsibility? It is convicting rather than condemning? Do I sense God's peace about it? Pastor Rick explains all of these questions and more in this message.

But its inconspicuousness was blown when police received an extraordinary 911 call from a 17-year-old girl. She claimed she and her 12 brothers and sisters, who ranged in age from 29 to 3, had for years been held against their will in the family home. She said they had been chained up, tortured and starved. Worst of all, she accused her parents of being responsible for the abuse. Following the emergency call, police and welfare authorities raided the home and rescued the children. They also arrested the parents, David and Louise Turpin. As Liam Bartlett reports, the mistreatment the 13 Turpin children endured is now considered to be one of the worst cases of child neglect and abuse in American history. But even more shockingly, he discovers the shameful family secret that started this nightmare.

Ex-Theranos employees describe culture of secrecy at Elizabeth Holmes' startup: ‘The Dropout’ podcast ep. 1

Not so long ago, Elizabeth Holmes was Silicon Valley’s rising star. Like so many of the most successful entrepreneurs before her, she dropped out of college to start a company. But unlike many others, her startup would go on to be valued at almost $10 billion making her the world’s youngest self-made female billionaire.

The company was called Theranos, a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.” It was praised for being revolutionary and for creating a breakthrough that would change the medical industry forever.

Her board of directors was a who’s who of government heavyweights that at a time included former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Secretaries of Defense Gen. James Mattis and William Perry and former U.S. Senators Bill Frist and Sam Nunn.

Investments came from some of the wealthiest and most connected people in the world, like media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family, the DeVos family and even the Kraft family behind the New England Patriots.

But it all came crashing down. Today, Holmes is facing up to 20 years in prison and awaiting a criminal trial for charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, to which she has pleaded not guilty.

vaccines,"Visiting North Korea | DW Documentary by DW Documentary 1 year ago 42 minutes 2,085,684 views","Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.

Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes.

Since the material is too useful to abandon, we're faced with two problems: how can we develop environmentally friendly products, and how do we clean up the plastics we've already discarded? We travel to a materials lab in Minnesota and a recycling plant in California to find the answers in this episode of Unsolvable.

vaccines,"You Need to Know About This Ridiculous Fish by vlogbrothers 13 hours ago 3 minutes, 58 seconds 72,902 views","I got to see an Ocean Sunfish (Mola mola) up close and personal at the Monterey Bay Aquarium recently and I fell in love. These things are the superlative of superlatives. They are the biggest bony fish, they lay the most eggs of any vertebrate, and grow the most from egg to full size of any vertebrate. Yes, they're silly looking, but the whole thing about evolution is, whether we can figure out why or not, things don't survive if they aren't good at /something/.

Sea turtles and mola mola, despite having deeply different lineages, actually share a lot of characteristics. They have the same shaped flippers, they both have beaks, they both rely on their size to protect them, and they both create lots of babies in the hopes that only a few will survive (though, Mola mola take this to a different level.) They're also both basically the same shape, which is super weird.

And here's a wild thing, even though sea turtles evolved from land-dwelling reptiles, mola mola-like fish have actually been around for 100 million years while sea turtles have been around for over 200 million years. 

Now, I'm just guessing here, but this is possibly because they share a food source. That food source is low quality but abundant. It also doesn't move fast. So the mola mola evolved not for speed, but for efficiency. These flippers (like the ones that turtles and mola have) don't move you fast, but they also don't use much energy. 

The fecundity of sunfish might also have something to do with the variability of their prey. Jellies are notorious for being extremely abundant year and then disappearing the next. In a situation like that,  you want to have the ability to rapidly increase your population and rapidly reach the age of maturity so that you can take advantage of prey population explosions.

When Evangelical Christian mom Susan Cottrell’s daughter came out, she faced an impossible choice: her LGBTQ child or her non-affirming church. In this heartwarming talk, Susan explains why she chose her LGBTQ child and how she fights for progress inside the Christian Church. Susan Cottrell is a prominent voice for faith parents of LGBTQI children. She is an international speaker, acclaimed author, and public theologian with a Masters in Theological Studies. After spending 25 years in the Evangelical church, she founded FreedHearts to champion the LGBTQI community and their families. She served as the Vice-President of PFLAG Austin (Texas) and was endorsed by The Human Rights Campaign and The Gay Christian Network. She has five children, two of whom are in the LGBTQI community, with her husband of 30 years, Rob. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Our ability to mine great amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful, utopian source of electricity. But rather than dominate the global electricity market, nuclear power has declined from a high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. What happened to the great promise of this technology? M.V.

He goes back on board the Royal Yacht Britannia where he makes good use of the Royal ice cream machine, and even recreates the wedding breakfast he helped serve up for the Prince of Wales and Princess Diana. He also gives a fascinating insight into the day-to-day food in a Palace – from eight sided cucumber sandwiches to a special dish of liver and rice, a firm favourite with the ever-present Royal corgis.

Vaccines - Calling the Shots, a new NOVA special, takes viewers around the world to track epidemics, explore the science behind vaccinations, and shed light on the risks of opting out. The vast majority of Americans vaccinate their children, and most do it on the recommended schedule. Yet many people have questions about the safety of vaccines, and in some communities, vaccination rates have fallen below the level needed to maintain “herd immunity” —allowing outbreaks to take hold and spread. This film draws on the latest, best available evidence to help parents find the answers. Highlighting real cases and placing them in historical context, Vaccines—Calling the Shots traces outbreaks of communicable diseases and demonstrates just how fast they can spread—and how many people can fall sick—when a community's immunity barrier falls.",Vaccines - Calling the Shots,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATcs0qhzfek,-1,,-1,3201,0,18,14,0,12,44

We are all conditioned with certain biases. In this experiment, we challenged these biases by asking people to guess their partner's interests and past experiences based only on their partner's appearance. When they learned their partner's real answers, they were shocked by how wrong they were.

Now tell YOUR story. What do people assume about you?

While some viewers might find advice provided in this talk to be helpful as a complementary approach, please do not look to this talk for medical advice. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf


What if someone you love is struggling with a major problem and you don't know how to help them? In this inspiring and fascinating talk, Dr. Clint Rogers begins by asking ""What is Wisdom?"" To help answer that question, Clint shares 3 remarkable experiences he had with Dr. Pankaj Naram, a master healer from an ancient Himalayan tradition, reveals limitless benefits and possibilities from 6 instruments outlined in the ancient science of Siddha-Veda, and ends with 3 questions which could change your life forever.  Clint Rogers, Ph.D., is CEO of the organization called
Wisdom of the World - looking for the best things that
exist on the planet and how more people can benefit
from them.
As a university researcher and author of upcoming book
“Ancient Secrets of a Master Healer: A Western Skeptic,
An Eastern Master, and Life’s Greatest Lessons”, Clint has
studied intensively for the last 7 years with Master Healer
Dr. Pankaj Naram and the Siddha-Veda healing lineage
of the Himalayas. Clint has documented and captured
their secrets on how anyone can live to more than 100
years with vibrant health, unlimited energy, and peace of
mind - and will demonstrate instant and limitless benefits
for you in following the 6 instruments of Siddha-Veda. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

An Associated Press photographer spotted the two M1A1 Abrams tanks, along with four other military vehicles, in a railyard at the southeastern edge of Washington. A military official earlier told the AP that the tanks were transported north from Fort Stewart in Georgia.
This comes after the president said Monday:  ""We're going to have some tanks stationed outside.""

The vehicles include M1A1 Abrams tanks, the type currently used by American armed forces, as well as Sherman tanks, the kind commonly used during World War II, according to the president. Having tanks rolling down the streets of D.C. had raised concerns due to their weight, with the Abrams tanks weighing upwards of 60 tons each. Trump acknowledged these concerns Monday, without offering many details.

""You've got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks,"" Trump said Monday. ""So we have to put them in certain areas, but we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abrams tanks.""

The military display is all part of the “Salute to America” event that Trump is putting on this Thursday.

""I'm going to say a few words and we're going to have planes going overhead, the best fighter jets in the world and other planes, too,"" Trump said. This includes a demonstration by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels.

There will also be fireworks near the Lincoln Memorial, which is where Trump is scheduled to speak.

Democrats, though, are worried that the president will turn the national event into a political rally.",SALUTE TO AMERICA: President Trump HISTORIC Lincoln Memorial speech,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci15wxwva3Y,5,,0,2896,537686,15281,685,0,5893,559545

A wealthy Yale dad had tipped off investigators. A Yale soccer coach had accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from families eager to secure a spot at the Ivy League school.

The prosecutors confirmed what almost everyone already suspected: our higher education system is no meritocracy. Vice News Tonight met with Yale undergraduate students from high and low income backgrounds as they processed the news during their spring break. ""I think people with a lot of money leveraging that to get into Yale was not surprising at all,"" explained Lily, a Yale senior from California who identifies as lower income. ""But the extent of it is shocking. I think at first I was very like 'Oh, I'm so unsurprised.' And then the next day I was like 'No, I'm actually really angry.' I think the anger took a while because it was so funny.""

For students from more affluent backgrounds, the scandal made them reflect on whether or not there was a moral difference between the fraud seen in this case and the socially accepted practice of wealthy families donating money and buying campus buildings. Ethan, a freshman and legacy of Yale, argued that at least donations have some benefit. ""I think there is a moral difference between perhaps donations versus bribery... the school benefits and for other kids tuition and it might pay for new programs or something that can benefit people. Bribery doesn't go to the school.""

vaccines,"Why Medical Bills In The US Are So Expensive by CNBC 6 months ago 14 minutes 1,155,270 views","The American health-care system is in a tug of war between physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceuticals and shareholders. At the center of it all are the patients.

Ashley Palmiscino's insurance company was billed roughly $4 million for her five-month-old son Luca's lung transplant. Her family had to turn to fundraising almost immediately just to keep up with the medical bills, and she's not alone. One-third of the money raised on GoFundMe last year went to medical campaigns.

So how did we get here, and how do we turn things around?

""Once there's all this money sloshing around in a system, there's this sort of pile-on effect where everyone wants to grab their bit of this huge pot of money,"" said Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former physician who wrote a book about how health care became big business.

""Now what we have as we're trying to take it back and reduce costs is everyone is desperately clinging to their piece of the pie.""

On 9th September 2015, Queen Elizabeth II became the longest serving British monarch. One of the most enduring images of her coronation in 1953 is that of Her Majesty surrounded by her dukes. Their influence once extended beyond the merely ceremonial, they were a crucial part of the architecture that supported the monarchy. Only 24 noble dukes now remain and this documentary - with unique access to the dukes of Norfolk, Argyll, Montrose and Marlborough – explores both the fascinating history and function of their great dukedoms in modern day Britain.

US Border Patrol Agent Tessa Reyes escorted us to multiple areas where migrants cross the border to begin their process of requesting asylum. 

The US has seen a major surge in Central American migrant families arriving in the US and requesting asylum, leaving Border Patrol agents and facilities overwhelmed. Per the Border Patrol, Business Insider was not allowed to film inside the processing center where immigrants are temporarily detained. 

During a visit to the Border Patrol's training academy in Artesia, New Mexico, we sat down with Acting Commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection John Sanders, who called the situation at the border ""unprecedented.""

This is part 2 of that conversation. 

Within the LGBTQ umbrella lies a multitude of identities and ideologies. In an effort to showcase this VICE gathers a diverse group of progressive and conservative members of the LGBTQ community to discuss topics that relate to queerness and its intersection with culture, and politics. 

Our goal is to foster conversations that are already happening within communities. With this format, we hope to give the viewer a rare opportunity to witness a conversation with people across the aisle that they otherwise might never find themselves in.

TIMECODES OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED:
00:29 - does Pete Buttigieg being gay make you want to vote for him?
2:08 - Identity Politics (things get heated)
3:20 - Pete Buttigieg as representation for LGBTQ+ people
3:55 - How do people feel about the terms GNC (""gender non-conforming"") and ""non-binary?""
11:08 - do you feel welcomed by the LGBTQ+ community?
14:29 - The Gender Binary

vaccines,"They were best friends, then pen pals — until one day, the letters stopped coming | Finding Fukue by CBC Docs 7 months ago 20 minutes 3,772,846 views","Almost 30 years after receiving the last letter from her pen-pal, Jessica Stuart returns to Japan to try and solve the mystery of her long-lost friend, Fukue. #CBCShortDocs 

Produced in Association with Real Stories. 

• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • 

It’s a mystery that spans decades, continents and cultures, and bridges one Toronto woman’s life with her childhood in Japan: what happened to Fukue?

In 1988, Jessica Stuart was nine years old. Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver’s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.

It was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.

Strangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.

As the Stuarts’ year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped — with no explanation.

Now a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue. Her memories of their time together are beautiful, but haunting. And so her thoughts turn to the unknown. Where is Fukue now? Does she remember Jessica? Why did her letters stop all those years ago?

Now, nearly 30 years after she left Japan, Jessica is going back to find the answers to these questions. She’s going to find Fukue.

In most developed nations across the globe, it is required for infants and certainly adults to be immunized against a variety of diseases. Really – who wants measles? Or how about chicken pox? These vaccinations were created to stem the tide of deaths that occurred throughout history from these diseases. Face it – medical practices from even a century ago were not what they are today in terms of effectiveness and they were certainly more barbaric in some cases.

Text version: http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-risks-of-vaccines.php

Coming up:

10. Religious beliefs against vaccinations (possible misconception)
9. Improved sanitation better than vaccinations (possible misconception)
8. MMR vaccines can cause Autism (possible misconception)
7. Thiomersal risks (possible misconception)
6. Aluminum adjuvants can cause health issues (possible misconception)
5. Vaccine Overload (possible misconception)

Myles Power confronts 9/11 truthers to see if their claims can stand up. In this video he discusses the World Trade Center's Design to withstand airplane impacts, fule or oxygen-starved fires, how the World Trade Center's Collapse, the twin towers falling at free fall speed and the damage to the lobbies.

Basic maths fail

These words were used by the George W. Bush, elected President of the United States in 2000, to dictate the political direction for the 21st Century.

Whereas Americans launch attacks relatively quickly, first on Afghanistan and later on Iraq, using falsified evidence, doubts about the official version of the events of September 11th grows. The speculations that surfaced on the internet directly after the attacks were considered to be just wild conspiracy theories until this now. Yet the circumstantial evidence and even the substantial evidence itself paints a clear picture. The responsibility for the terrible attacks seems to lie not with Islamic Terrorists but with several high-ranking members of the military and administration of the U.S. Government. This documentary focuses on the inconsistencies in the official version of the events as well as on the evidence which has been suppressed regarding September 11th. In addition, it answers the questions of why we still know nothing about it to this day and why we are being deceived  also in european countries.

Each of us has ever seen the contrails behind a jet aircraft. The white clouds stretch across the horizon until it is finally covered with a murky haze. Spontaneously we would say that it can not be simply contrails of jet engine is here. The question ""Who is doing this and why?"" so far, however, no one went to the bottom.
This film has changed everything. It is the story of a fast growing industrial sector called geoengineering. Geoengineering, operated by scientists, companies and States, has the aim of changing our global climate, controlling the weather, and to modify the chemical composition of the soil and the water, apparently for the welfare of humanity. Although official voices emphasize these projects were still at the discussion stage, there is plenty of evidence that they are carried out since 1990, with devastating effects on crops, the fauna and flora, as well as on human health. Unintentionally we come into contact with poisonous substances. In addition, we are still brazenly lied. Do not watch this film if you suffer from high blood pressure!

They're called contrails - at least that's the widely accepted term for them.

But if you ask around Hollywood, then you might be more likely to hear them called chemtrails - an evil government plot.

For example, Kylie Jenner, of Kardiashian fame, tweeted her concern since all the honeybees are getting exterminated, and even went as far to ask whos is ""responcible""?

Rosanne Barr thinks someone's destroying our food supplies and Prince says it's all about mind control to cause chaos.

And Donkeylips [Michael Bower] of ""Salute Your Shorts"" fame says they're putting aluminum in the clouds to control the weather with magnets.

What about science? Simple physics tells us they're formed when the hot, humid jet exhaust condenses in the much colder air around it - this is similar to being able to see your breath on a really cold day.

If atmospheric conditions are just right, they can linger for an hour or more and sometimes spread out across the sky.

They've even done studies on this.

Since these are formed by jets, and following 9/11 [September 11th], there weren't any jets flying in the skies, some scientists took advantage of the situation and did a little research.

They found high temperatures were a little cooler and low temperatures were a little warmer when contrails were present as opposed to when they were absent.

So basically, they do the same thing clouds do. These are just man-made.

⇩⇩ Please Read The Description ⇩⇩
-----------------------------------------------------
09/28/16 - 19 : 41 I caught an extraordinary UFO sighting. I was watching an odd looking light crossing the sky at variable speeds around my house, during the sunset. To me it was just some sort of helicopter, or maybe a drone. But after 5 or 10 minutes, I began suspecting the object not to be man-made. It was performing weird maneuvers, accelerating and decelerating randomly. When the light started to accelerate towards a huge Chemtrail, I took my camcorder and tried to find it in the distance.

The object stopped in front of the Chemtrail, and slowly destroyed it. Indeed, the trail was being ""consumed"" progressively. I was simply speechless. I still can't believe what I caught. The Chemtrail got literally perforated! I can't be 100% sure it's due to the object itself, but I'm sure there's a link between it and the Chemtrail. Such a huge trail can't just disappear like that, for no reason! And only a small portion of the trail gets erased, justly around the object!

After the UFO attacked the trail, it moved backwards and flied West, in my opposite direction. It disappeared pretty quickly.

Sorry for zooming out a little bit too early, my camcorder screen is really small, and doesn't have that much pixels... The object got so far away at the end, I simply thought it was not there anymore.

What was that object? Man-made prototype to delete Chemtrails? Some extra-terrestrial technology made to protect us? (maybe a bit far-fetched, but seriously, have you ever seen that before?) I just don't have a clue of what this is.

This has been going on for months, constantly, so this video is nothing new. This video was made because I saw a collosal Haarp outflow boundary, and thought it warranted it's own video. 

The contractors, who edit the satellite images, have been told to NEVER show a Haarp outflow boundary, but in this case, it was so HUGE, that it did not meet the editing criteria (laid out by the Navy laison officer). So, it was a big screw-up, all around. It definitely needed a video, to show the world how powerful this technology is.
How Do Ionospheric Heaters Control the Weather? The US Navy SBX-1 transmits 20 megawatts of microwave power, in a pinpoint, computer steered beam. Picture: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-based_X-band_Radar#/media/File:Sbx_050701_001.jpg 
By rapidly heating an oval perimeter (or arched vault) in the lowest layer of the ionosphere, a plasma jet shoots from the center of the heated area, downwards. It is similar to a drop of water, shot up by waves crashing together. The D layer is the lowest layer, and is 30 miles up. It only forms in the daytime, and that is why, Haarp weather control only happens mid morning, to early evening. The pinpoint beam, of the ionospheric heater, chases the smoke ring shaped ""plasmoid"", downwards, by heating the top side. This keeps it moving down, while maintaining the needed ionization. Shaping, and aiming, are done at this time, and the microwave power requirement increases with the density of the surrounding air. As the plasmoid hits the upper atmosphere, it shows up as an unexplained high pressure, in the jetstream. Many times, the inertia of the descending plasma is enough to produce a series of concentric, dry air, roll clouds, in the mid layers of the atmosphere. These dry air, concentric, roll clouds move radially outward, for hours, and are PROOF, that a ""Haarp downburst"" just occurred. These Haarp downbursts were commonly seen in shortwave infrared, on GOES-15, before I began this youtube channel. For the first six months of this channel, most of my disclosures were followed by more photoshopping of the satellite images. This culminated in NASA deleting years of their Terra and Aqua satellite images, since it was too costly to photoshop all the old hi-res pictures. NASA claims it was a hard drive failure - how pathetic! Now, we have blurred IR satellite images, with almost no detail, as a result of this covert, weather warfare program. 
The ionosphere is a HUGE reservoir of potential energy, and by using an ionspheric heater in the right way, the ionosphere will AMPLIFY the energy transmitted into it. This is how a thousand-mile-wide weather event can be created by a few US Navy, 20 Megawatt (average power), pin-point beam, microwave transmitters. It has taken the US Navy, about 20 years, to figure all of this out, build the SBX platforms, write the software, and put up the needed satellites. So, here's the evidence, made public on youtube. 

Our planet is dying VERY RAPIDLY now, as a result of the Ionospheric Heaters (and chemtrails). The oceans are dying, because of increasing ultraviolet-B. The modern Haarp transmitters punch holes in the ozone layer, since they must drive a plasmoid, from 30 miles high, down to the jet stream, which is 5 miles high. The ozone layer is 18 miles up, so each ionospheric weather control operation, is punching holes in the ozone layer, and mixing the chemtrails vertically, which breaks down the protective ozone layer. The pacific is dying because the base of the food chain, phyto-plankton, are being killed by the high UV-B, created by the ionospheric heaters. Fukushima is being used as a ""cover"" for the excess UV-B, caused by Haarp and chemtrails. That would explain the complete lack of action to stop the radiation, leaking into the Pacific.

As the oceans die, the planet's carbon sink will stop working, and global warming turns, permanently, into global broiling. These weather warfare programs must be stopped, and de-classified NOW, otherwise, we go extinct, and the entire planet dies. (The doomsday Siberian Traps methane is now venting, in addition to the doomsday Arctic Methane: http://arctic-news.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/north-siberian-arctic-permafrost-methane-eruption-vents.html/)

80% of the oxygen we breathe, comes from plankton blooms, in the ocean. As the oceans die, oxygen levels ARE falling, and will fall even faster in the future. Humans cannot survive, with a reduced oxygen level.
This is an extreme planetary emergency. The world must come together, to stop these ionospheric heaters, or a doomsday heating of +12 degrees C will happen, over the next few decades.

with weather modification technology that can also to shield radar tracking signals! A growing concern is
that chemtrails including biological, toxic heavy metals, radiation and chemical experiments are also being
done in preparation to control and reduce the human population on our planet by spreading viruses and
disease. Proof of chemtrails are solid and a large surge of increased chemical spraying with heavy metals
have been measured in our air, water and soil before and after chemtrail spraying in active areas. Some
of these toxic heavy metals include Cadmium, Barium, Arsenic, Mercury, Lead, Uranium, Chromium and
Thorium. When these heavy metals enter your body from the air, water or from the food that you eat,
they can weaken the immune system and allow sick mutated cells to form and propagate.
This is BLATANTLY INHUMAN and don't think that these chemtrails are BS because it isn’t! The
Chemtrail Spraying Is Real! Keep your eyes to the sky and take notice! Every single day new chemtrail
videos are being shot and shown on U-Tube for you to see. Then think about how you may be able to do
something of real value to stop the elite that are controlling our world Governments and humanity while
poisoning much of life on our planet! People of the world must band together to stop this poisoning of our
planet, because if it continues insects, animals, fish, sea life and mankind will be reduced by huge numbers
while dying off because of drastic environmental changes that will affect all food chains, the weather,
temperature of the planet and the disease and sickness that will accompany it will be amazing and
devastating!","Chemtrails/ pilot says. Its a necessary evil, chemtrails are true",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AM5ThkJIde8,1,,1,166,4421,44,11,0,24,4500
chemtrails,"Secret Chemtrail Pilot Speaks, on Dec 8, 2014 by The HAARP Report 4 years ago 11 minutes 1,464,536 views","This video contains text, which was forwarded to me. The source is highly credible, and has given permission to post his youtube account here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRsWDIVEpgVdHbpyIzWnARA/videos     If you have questions, you can contact him directly.   This message originally came from a USAF pilot, who flies Aerosol Tankers, as part of the secret Indigo Skyfold (geoengineered aerosol ""chemtrail"") program.
Please save this text, and forward the video! (The text was too long for Youtube to put in the description, so I will put the entire message in the comments section.)

I've known the source for over a year, and I have POST confirmation of most of the things he's told me, IN ADVANCE. 
Also, IF THIS WAS DISINFO, the last message from the pilot would be ""after Jan 20, 2015, they are shutting down the program"". 
INSTEAD, he says the opposite: ""a very new ""extremely toxic"" chemtrail mix, is going to be sprayed. Using new technology, that makes these special chemtrails, completely invisible.""
That is not how disinfo works. The last communication was the opportunity to calm the herd, instead, it is a call to action.
If you have a geiger counter, with an alpha/beta probe, please test the aerosol fallout. The best way to test the aerosols, is to wipe your car hood, and windshield, with a clean paper towel, after a dry period of heavy spraying. Then, test the towel for alpha and beta radiation. This is especially important in California, which has no natural radon sources upwind.

BTW, the building at 7:30 is the International Criminal Court, at The Hague, Netherlands. This is where the criminals behind these programs need to be taken, to be put on trial, while the world watches.

P.S. if anyone can do a better job of narration, please upload your own video! Don't let this disappear from the internet! 
The first comment has the complete pilot text, so please copy it, and spread the word.

I am sorry you got hit by the copyright complaint I had to file. I am writing you this letter as a courtesy so that you do not get hit with another strike regarding this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnWaBsMYnY . I have never filed any such copyright complaint and people all over the world repost my work all the time. The paragraph below is what I sent to the original party that posted the edited version. If you make the corrections I outlined below, and re-upload the video making clear that geoengineeringwatch and my youtube channel is the source (instead of the appearance in the beginning of the edited video that it was produced by “galactic service”), then I would be absolutely fine with you re-posting this video. I have never filed any copyright complaint before, I don’t want to do it again if it can possibly be avoided. Original video http://youtube.com/watch?v=O4WhYKP83zo

(The letter I sent to person that posted the edited version in a deceptive manner)

Hello Johannes, I actually had people contacting me and asking if I knew of or had any connection to the video in question that you posted. It seemed that considerable effort was made to mask the source of the video and create the appearance that the video was done by your group (Galactic Service). You did not in any way give credit to geoengineeringwatch.org as the source of the video, showing a youtube link far below your verbiage is not sufficient in this kind of situation. Others then downloaded from your copy and did not even properly show the links so there was no original youtube link whatsoever. I have always allowed any and all use of GeoengineeringWatch information and data so long as those that reposted this data properly and respectfully credited the source. Our goal is to get credible and verifiable data out to the public, nothing more. I have never sold a single thing on my site. Not only have I never made a cent, I have spent the whole of my retirement account on this battle. In regard to the video you uploaded, I paid for the organization of the event, I paid for the filming, I paid for the editing, and the downloading. As I mentioned, countless other sites repost geoengineeringwatch.org data all the time, some have over 730,000 views on my presentations, but they properly credited the source so I have no issue with their reposting. Some sites that just reposted your version push conclusions that are completely unsupported by factual data. This means that what I worked so hard to produce is now bringing attention to sites that are not putting out credible information. This completely defeats everything I have worked toward for over 10 solid years. My life's energy is focus on one cause, exposing and stopping global climate engineering.

Sincerely

UPDATE: The big white General Motors building was closed in 2005, bought by Oklahoma City in 2006, leased to USAF in 2009. This building may have been used for chemtrail processing from 2010 to 2015 (approx.) Please don't tell me what is going on there, now. That doesn't explain what was going on there several years ago. 

Google maps, street view, blurs out the building, after USAF took it over, so they are definitely hiding something.  Google Hides SW Corner of Tinker AFB (Old GM Plant): https://youtu.be/ZXD8n1fF1wg

If you don't believe Tinker was a hub for coal ash spraying, search for Kristen Meghan's youtube's, where she blows the whistle on Tinker AFB ordering toxic chemicals (which later fell from the sky). She is the other half of this picture, an insider who is brave and heroic enough, to speak the truth to power, about poisoning the planet.

 By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers, government agents have carefully kept the massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps. Snowden added, “I am only revealing this program because there is no oversight in the scientific community, no public discussion, and little concern for the side-effects which are well known only to a few privileged people interested in continuing the decades-long chemtrail program in secret.”

An impeccably timed eye opening expose, the film reveals the campaign to normalize chemical cloud formations via atmospheric aerosol dispersals. Up against a normalization timetable encompassing a controlled media and an indoctrinated educational and political system, activists ask the question : Is your silence your consent?

Of course, HAARP and HAARP-like facilities as well as chemtrails play their role.

In this video I am breaking down older technolgies, but there are new ones like NEXRAD and SBX-1.

OVERCAST ist ein Dokumentarfilm über ein Phänomen, das für die meisten von uns ganz normal ist: Flugzeugstreifen, die sich zu Wolken ausbreiten und den Himmel sowie die Sonne bedecken. Seit über einem Jahrzehnt gibt das Phänomen jedoch Anlass für heftige Kontroversen und Spekulationen.  Für einige Menschen, handelt es sich dabei um das größte Umweltverbrechen der Menschheitsgeschichte und um die gezielte 
Veränderung des Klimas. Neueste Forschungen zeigen, dass die künstliche Bewölkung durch den Flugverkehr tatsächlich das Klima verändern und das weit stärker als bisher angenommen. 

OVERCAST thematisiert ein in der Klimadebatte und öffentlichen Diskussion längst fälliges Thema, das bisher völlig ausser Acht gelassen wurde.

These so called sky trails are super close to me and I suspect they are super close to all of us. 

Our minds are programmed our whole life to think planes fly high. So why else would we see them differently. But the P-900 is showing us the truth. These trails are demons laying the demonic seeds of doubt through out our communities.  

If you see the sky for what it really is then you won't be fooled. The sky is just a few thousand feet high and goes level with our ground. So when you see a plane going down or up know that the plane is going straight an the same level throughout it's passage by you.

I can zoom planes 1,2,3 miles and they all are hard to zoom in on and get tracking numbers or basically any clarity what so ever. 

Get almost any chemtrail planes 5-7 miles away and they are crystal clear in appearance. How is this even a possibility that objects 7 miles away always appear clearer than objects 2-3 miles away. 

I also zoom on waste treatment facility 5 miles away and it's blurry with 83x zoom P-900. But the chemtrail plane is super clear at 7 miles away. Cased closed this isn't even possible.

July 2017 by Affected Collective 1 year ago 20 minutes 571,170 views","This is a RE-UPLOAD of my previous video compilation of airplanes in mid-air exhibiting strange phenomena, with COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL REMOVED.

NOTE TO  ALL YOUTUBERS whose footage I used in the making of this video: Thank-you for allowing this footage to be used for the educational purposes intended.  IF YOU WISH TO HAVE YOUR FOOTAGE REMOVED FROM THIS COMPILATION (or you'd like me to revise or omit the link to and/or reference to your channel) PLEASE CONTACT ME - I'm happy to comply with any request you have regarding your footage, and I'll do my best to respond as promptly as possible. THANK YOU & MUCH LOVE!  ❤️  NOTE: This is a RE-UPLOAD of a previous version of this video with COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL REMOVED. If the YouTuber whose footage was removed is satisfied with said removal of material, please consider kindly retracting the copyright strike now placed on my channel, and I hope I have not caused you any inconvenience. I do sincerely apologize. Much love to you. 

If you see a plane in the sky going backwards or stopped, GET VIDEO OF IT immediately!  I experienced this strange phenomenon myself in late April of 2017, and it's SO SURREAL that I almost didn't capture it on camera because I couldn't believe my own eyes--I spent several minutes telling myself it was just an illusion before I finally got out my phone & caught the ""tail end"" (pun intended lolol) of it.  

Luckily, the stationary plane was still in the same place in the sky, although unluckily, the vehicle I was began moving again (in the opposite direction the plane was facing), so MY footage is not-so-great. I estimate I saw it hovering there between 3-8 minutes before I took video. It even seemed to be going backwards at times.  It's a REAL MINDFLUX to witness such a thing first-hand, so if you happen across such an opportunity, Remember one of these helpful rhymes:
""DON'T DELAY, VIDEO THAT PLANE!""
""DON'T BE SLOW, FILM IT, YO!""
For Canadians, or when in Canada: ""FORGET ""ABOOT"" IT, POINT & SHOOT IT!""

chemtrails,"Ex Government Employee talks about CHEMTRAILS Full Video by Magnet Motor News 4 years ago 44 minutes 5,722 views","- The chemtrail program is also known as ""Project Cloverleaf"", and it is very compartmentalized. Even the pilots themselves have no real idea of why they are actually spraying.

- Chemtrails are a sub-program of the US Navy's Radio Frequency Mission Planner (RFMP) program called the Variable Terrain Radio Parabolic Equation (VTRPE) - a system for creating 3D battlefield imaging that the US military has been using in Iraq and Afghanistan

- Some of the chemtrail contents are biological in nature such as BCTP - an anti-anthrax inoculation that was tested on US populations

- Clifford Carnicom has identified many of the very harmful biologicals coming out of chemtrails.

- Chemtrails are also linked to SCALAR weaponry controlled by the Russians which operate on three distinct levels:

.....1. Energetics: destruction of aircraft; the Challenger; directed earthquakes, volcanic activity and hurricanes

.....2. Bio-energetics: affecting human health and energy

.....3. Psycho-energetics: mind control and behavior modification

- Scalar transmitters in Russia are controlled by their Federal Security Bureau (FSB)

- Scalar weaponry produce gravitational waves. There is nothing we can do to prevent this from happening. We are in a desperate time, and most of the people in the US are completely oblivious to what is happening, and are doing nothing because of political correctness.

- Israel has protected the US from Russian scalar attacks on many occasions.

- Mysterious sonic booms are caused by Russian interferometry affecting American air space. It is the same system that causes man-made earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and 'psycho-energetics.' They can take our cities down any time they want to. The only real deterrent is to take them out. (It is unclear whether Griffith meant 'taking out' the transmitters, or the deployment of 'Tesla domes' over US cities which he mentioned is the technology that was really created using money slated for an anti-missile defense shield.)

The exponential exhaustion of natural resources, declining productivity, slow growth, rising unemployment, and steep inequality, forces us to rethink our economic models. Where do we go from here? In this feature-length documentary, social and economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin lays out a road map to usher in a new economic system. 

A Third Industrial Revolution is unfolding with the convergence of three pivotal technologies: an ultra-fast 5G communication internet, a renewable energy internet, and a driverless mobility internet, all connected to the Internet of Things embedded across society and the environment. 

This 21st century smart digital infrastructure is giving rise to a radical new sharing economy that is transforming the way we manage, power and move economic life. But with climate change now ravaging the planet, it needs to happen fast. Change of this magnitude requires political will and a profound ideological shift.

The NSA data-monitoring program which Binney and his team had developed  -- codenamed ThinThread -- was being aimed not at foreign targets as intended, but at Americans (codenamed as Stellar Wind); destroying privacy here and around the world. Binney voices his call to action for the billions of individuals whose rights are currently being violated. 

William Binney speaks out in this feature-length interview with Tragedy and Hope's Richard Grove, focused on the topic of the ever-growing Surveillance State in America.

I have personally seen them not only in the United States, but in Mexico and in Canada. Birds are dying around the world.  Fish are dying by the hundreds of thousands around the world.

I happen to know of two of the locations where the airplanes are that dump this crap on us.  Four of the planes are out of the Air National Guard in Lincoln, Nebraska.  And, the other planes are out of Fort Sill, Oklahoma. I personally have observed the planes that were standing still in Nebraska - Lincoln, Nebraska - at the Air National Guard.  They have no markings on them. They are huge, bomber-like airplanes with no markings.  This is a crime: a crime against humanity, a crime against America, a crime against the citizens of this great country.  The must be stopped.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH CONGRESS?  This has an affect on their population, and their people, and their friends, and their relatives, and themselves.  What's wrong with them?

Thomas Drake is an Former NSA Executive & Whistleblower

SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToLondonReal

Jesselyn Radack  & Thomas Drake are a force to be reckoned with.  She is the legal adviser to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and the Director of National Security & Human Rights at the Government Accountability Project.  He is a former senior executive of the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and a whistleblower.  In 2006, Thomas leaked information about the NSA's data-gathering Trailblazer Project and was prosecuted under the Espionage Act, but in 2010, but the case collapsed.

Both of them were in London to give the annual Sam Adams Award for Integrity and Intelligence to this year's winner Private Chelsea Manning.  Jesselyn had just been harassed by the UK Border Police and spoke about being questioned about her representation of Edward Snowden and Private Manning.

Thomas Drake has an incredible story that inspired Edward Snowden to flee the country and release information with a very specific protocol.  After seeing the way that Thomas was treated by the government Edward knew that he would never be protected by any type of Whistleblowing statute if he remained on American soil.

Please join me in welcoming these two to London Real and support them on their quest to protect Whistleblowers and thereby protect our basic human rights as individuals.

“I believe the chemtrails are responsible for a chemical intoxication of the public, which would then cause a general immune suppression, low grade to high grade, depending on exposure.

This, he claims is where the pharmaceutical firms come in to sell the cure.

He said: ""You create a dependence and thereby you weaken the population, and weakened populations are easy to control.

""They don’t want to totally eliminate populations completely, just certain populations. 

“And isn’t it, from their perspective, wonderful? They’ve got a covert depopulation agenda that nobody’s picked up on yet. It’s ideally what they want to produce.""

ther extreme claims made by the former dentist are that Aids, swine flu and ebola were all man-made to devastate populations.

He also believes in the Illuminati, and alleged secretive, and satanic organisation, which actually run the world’s governments, and who are constantly trying to bring about a New World Order and exert more control over us.

I'm 38 and not getting any younger 😉... I live in Detroit, I'm a father of two and I am at that common point, we all get to, where I am sick of the music that is being made today, because I just don't relate to it. I'd like to blame age, but I think it's more than that. It doesn't seem like anyone is making music for my generation, which I think is silly, because we are such a HUGE market. So I teamed up with my buddy in Germany in June 2015 and TBG is what we came up with. It's geared towards people 30+, who have some life experience, have REAL questions, are sick of just nodding their heads to a beat and who are going through the same thing we are musically, basically, sick of their extensive collection because they've heard it too many times and not able to enjoy much of the new stuff. I hope you enjoy the sample (there are 27 total videos) and if you have a minute, please give me some feedback. Thank you very much...

flatearth,"FLAT EARTH BRITISH. The Day Vancouver Exploded 'Wiped Out Of Existence' 1886. by Martin Liedtke 1 day ago 1 hour, 44 minutes 9,577 views","Oi! I'm back with the highly suspect story of the Great Fire Of Vancouver 1886. The established city with massive Tartarian type structures are cited to have taken three months to build we check the photographic record and ponder how this would be humanly possible. We find the City exploded and was wiped of the face of the Earth in 20 minutes flat. We examine the case for clues of the eradication of a civilisation taken out of history 'Tarty'! We look at Wales & the 1960s TV show The Prisoner or to be more specific the very suspect old world architecture of The Village the show was filmed at Porthmeirion North Wales. What we find is this mindblowing setting was cited of being built in the 1920s so we search for evidence of that and find none. And pics of the day and much more besides all that was presented will be linked and i do hope you enjoy the video share or like it.And please make sure to Subscribe click that bell and come back and don't miss a thing on FEB.

And the subhead reads, ""a poll says lots of millennials evidently do…and it’s not entirely clear why."" So, the piece is supposedly all about how lots of millennials are flat-earthers, or, in other words, how young people are becoming dumber. And because of that sensational lead, lots of people were tweeting links to the story, and lots of people now believe that humans are becoming more stupid. But the entire article actually debunks that headline, and thus completes the real cycle of dumb. The Resident breaks it down.

Our universe is not a very diverse place when it comes to shapes. Large celestial bodies become spheres, galaxies become discs, and there is little room for variation. Why is this? Well it turns out physics has some pretty strict rules when it comes to creating new planetary bodies. On this week's Space Time, we explore equillibrium and symmetry, the two defining factors that shape our universe.

vaccines,"How One Washington State Senator Is Rationalizing The Measles Outbreak (HBO) by VICE News 5 days ago 8 minutes, 3 seconds 81,964 views","CLARK COUNTY, Washington — The United is currently home to six ongoing measles outbreaks. But with 70 confirmed cases, Clark County, Washington in particular, has gotten a lot of attention. It’s quickly become a classic example of what happens when parents hesitate to vaccinate their children. Still, the spread of a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease hasn’t been enough to change everyone’s minds about vaccines.

Washington State Senator Lynda Wilson told VICE News during a recent interview that she believes the measles vaccine has caused more harm than the disease itself — a statement that has been debunked by multiple peer-reviewed studies, including a massive study published this week. She also said she hasn’t actively reached out to any scientists or doctors to verify her opinion on the matter. “I'm kind of busy up here, and so I'm just dealing with what I'm getting from my constituents,” she said.

The measles is a nasty disease that can lead to serious complications, including swelling of the brain and pneumonia. It also kills around 1 or two children out of every 1000 who become infected. That’s why scientists recommend the vaccine, which is both safe and effective. But right now, Clark County has an unusually low vaccination rate.

So, Senator Wilson’s view of vaccines aren’t just emblematic of the crisis — they could also have an impact on upcoming legislation. A proposed bill would eliminate one of Washington’s non-medical vaccine exemptions, the philosophical exemption, and Senator Wilson has already said she plans to vote to keep the exemption. “I don't believe that everyone should be having to do them,” she said, in reference to vaccines.  

Despite having vaccinated her own children when they were younger, Wilson doesn’t think parents should be required to do so with their own kids — at least not American parents. “The cases are coming from out of the country,” she said. “So, you know, maybe what we should do is start thinking about requiring vaccinations if you're coming into our country. Maybe they should be vaccinated instead of requiring all of our people to be vaccinated.”

The CDC says that the current measles outbreaks are linked to travelers. But there’s little evidence to suggest that vaccinating visitors to the United States would be at all effective. That’s because the measles vaccine, called MMR, is only 93 percent protective after a single dose, so people who aren’t vaccinated can still get sick. That’s why scientists say it’s important for communities to reach a certain vaccination rate — a concept called “herd immunity.”  When a high number of individuals in a community are vaccinated, that limits the spread of disease and prevents those who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated from becoming sick.

“Measles continues to exist in other countries and within the United States,” a spokesperson for Clark County Public Health told VICE News. “As long as measles is present elsewhere, it’s only a plane, car, train or boat ride away from our community and will continue to be a risk for our community or any community with large unvaccinated populations.”

Senator Wilson says the current outbreak is under control. Moreover, she says the people who were infected will benefit from the disease. “We didn't have any deaths, and we didn't have any hospital stays. So I don't know that it’s unacceptable,” she said. “I mean, now these people have full immunity for the rest of their lives.”

VICE News went to Washington state to see how the measles outbreak is impacting a parent, a pediatrician, and a legislator.

And yet, vaccine opposition and hesitancy ""are now impairing our ability to effectively ensure coverage,"" he said. McCullers, pediatrician-in-chief at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, explained how pediatricians can play an important role in counselling parents who get much of their misinformation online or from uninformed opinions on social media. But for parents who aren't swayed by their doctors, McCullers says broader educational and policy fixes are needed to combat this public health threat.

What is True Cellular Detox™ ?
Think of your body as a bucket. A drop here and there isn’t such a big deal; however, chronic exposure to an onslaught of chemical, physical and emotional stressors fills up your bucket each day, and at some point the bucket begins to overflow. It may take a few decades before your bucket spills over, but once it does, cellular inflammation is triggered and unwanted symptoms arise.
The True Cellular Detox™ is unique because it addresses toxicity in the cells and in the brain. Achieve the ultimate goal. Nourish and cleanse the brain and nerve tissue using fat-soluble ""true binders"".
True Cellular Detox™ supports the body’s natural ability to detox, which can help you realize your greatest level of health.

Vaccination bypasses the TH1 cellular responses (responsible for 80% of our immune function according to Dr. Toni Bark) yet the immune system works best when both TH1 and TH2 work synergistically together. Vaccination destroys the synergy of the immune system because injection bypasses normal route of entry (through the lungs, often times) whereby TH1 cell response is the first response to happen. An antibody response is not an indicator of immunity, only of an allergic response. Natural immunity and being vaccine free is the healthiest option for children.

vaccines,"What's Really In Vaccines? Mercury, MSG, Formaldehyde, Aluminum the shocking truth! by Russell Blaylock M.D 5 years ago 11 minutes 61,845 views","(NaturalNews) Have you ever wondered what's really in vaccines? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's vaccine additives page, all the following ingredients are routinely used as vaccine additives:

• Aluminum - A light metal that causes dementia and Alzheimer's disease. You should never inject yourself with aluminum.

• Antibiotics - Chemicals that promote superbugs, which are deadly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that are killing tens of thousands of Americans every year.

• Formaldehyde - A ""pickling"" chemical used to preserve cadavers. It's highly toxic to the nervous system, causing blindness, brain damage and seizures. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services openly admits that formaldehyde causes cancer. You can see this yourself on the National Toxicology Program website, featuring its 12th Report on Carcinogens.

• Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) - A neurotoxic chemical called an ""excitotoxin."" It causes brain neurons to be overexcited to the point of death. MSG is toxic even when consumed in foods, where it causes migraine headaches and endocrine system damage. You should NEVER inject MSG into your body. But that's what health workers do when they inject you with vaccines.

• Thimerosal - A methyl mercury compound that causes severe, permanent nervous system damage. Mercury is highly toxic to the brain. You should never touch, swallow or inject mercury at any dose. There is no safe dose of mercury! Doctors and vaccine pushers LIE to you and say there is no mercury in vaccines. Even the CDC readily admits vaccine still contain mercury (thimerosal).

In addition, National Toxicology Programs admits in its own documents that:

• Vaccinations ""...may produce small but measurable increases in blood levels of mercury.""

• ""Thimerosal was found to cross the blood-brain and placenta barriers.""

• The ""...hazards of thimerosal include neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity."" (This means brain and kidney toxicity.)

• ""...similar toxicological profiles between ethylmercury and methylmercury raise the possibility that neurotoxicity may also occur at low doses of thimerosal.""

• ""... there are no existing guidelines for safe exposure to ethylmercury, the metabolite of thimerosal.""

• ""...the assessment determined that the use of thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines might result in the intake of mercury during the first six months of life that exceeded recommended guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)...""

• ...""In the U.S., thimerosal is still present as preservative in some vaccines given to young children, as well as certain biological products recommended during pregnancy. Thimerosal remains a preservative in some vaccines administered to adolescents and adults. In addition, thimerosal continues to be used internationally as a vaccine preservative.""

The report then goes on to say that the FDA studies thimerosal and somehow found it to be perfectly safe. It also states that vaccine manufactures are ""working"" to remove thimerosal from vaccines, but in reality it's still being manufactured right into the vaccines.

By the way, this report also reveals that the FDA requires preservatives like thimerosal only in so-called ""multi-dose"" vaccines -- vials that contain more than one dose of the vaccine. Drug companies could, if they wanted to, produce ""clean"" single-dose vaccines without any mercury / thimerosal. But they choose not to because it's more profitable to product mercury-containing multi-dose vaccines. As the report admits, ""Preservatives are not required for products formulated in singledose vials. Multidose vials are preferred by some physicians and health clinics because they are often less expensive per vaccine dose and require less storage space.""

So the reason why your child is being injected with vaccine boils down to health care offices making more money and saving shelf space!

""Mercury in vaccines is a conspiracy theory!
I've been told by numerous ""skeptics"" and doctors that there's no such thing as mercury in vaccines, and that any such suggestion is nothing more than a ""wild conspiracy theory."" That just goes to show you how ignorant all the skeptics, doctors and health professionals really are: They have NO CLUE what's in the vaccines they're dishing out to people!

All they have to do is visit this CDC vaccine additives web page, which openly admits to these chemicals being used in vaccines right now. It's not a conspiracy theory, it turns out. It's the status quo of modern-day vaccine manufacturing!

vaccines,"Vaccine Nation (Documentary) by lovethyneighbor as thyself 2 years ago 1 hour, 29 minutes 53,428 views","At the end of the eighteenth century, British physician Edward Jenner, with highly questionable medical credentials, initiated the theory and practice of live virus immunization that continues to serve as the scientific basis for the ever increasing vaccination of the world’s citizens. With the number of vaccinations given to infants and children rising, kids are receiving doses of toxic mercury and other heavy metals well above environmental safety levels.

Yet the medical evidence is clear. Mercury, known as thimerosal, and other heavy metal additives are highly toxic and threaten children with neurological damage. The long-term efficacy of global vaccination remains controversial, inconclusive and is suspect in light of the powerful corporate interests, lobbying efforts, and profits associated with a multi-billion dollar vaccine industry..

In his documentary film Vaccine Nation, award-winning investigative film director Dr. Gary Null challenges the basic health claims by government health agencies and pharmaceutical firms that vaccines are perfectly safe. This is one of the most critical questions facing today’s children and future generations to come. If inoculation with a large regimen of vaccines is safe, what can account for the rapid increase in autism and other mental disabilities that are now at epidemic proportions? And why isn’t the sudden onset of neurological illnesses in children being treated as an urgent crisis by our government and medical industries?

Weaving together interviews with many of the nations most expert medical researchers, private physicians specializing in autism, parents of children victimized by immunization, congressmen, vaccination activists, legal authorities and more, Vaccine Nation will awaken viewers to one of the continual perils to the health and future of children.

Know the Truth the Ingredients in the vaccines that are Causing many Disease and Cancer and Disability's Damaged of your Brain and Internal Organs and Many other Problem and kill your brain cells 
The nervous system is very sensitive to all forms of mercury
Autism is not present in unvaccinated children, only the vaccinated
Vaccines and the Ingredients that are purposely in these vaccines  are a Crime Against Humanity and a Population Control 
If you are a parent of a baby or young children, expecting a baby or if you are a health professional you need to watch this lecture filmed at a Radio Liberty Seminar in October 2008 in which Russell Blaylock MD discusses the effect of vaccines on the developing brain and his concerns about the increasingly crowded infant vaccination schedule. 

Dr Blaylock also provides compelling arguments why the vaccination of pregnant women is harmful and a hidden cause of neurological disorders. He also discusses the toxic ingredients in vaccines such as formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum and MSG and the detrimental effects they have on the brain and nervous system. He also touches on other vaccine-related topics, such as the conflicts of interests influencing vaccination policy due to the influence the pharmaceutical industry exerts on the government and the pharmaceutical industry, the polio epidemics in Africa, mercury toxicity and other medical scandals. 

CDC officials claim vaccines are safe and effective. Is that true? If vaccines are safe, why has the incidence of autism increased from one case of autism in 10,000 to one case of autism in every 50 American children in the past few years, in parallel with a huge increase in the number of vaccines the government is promoting as part of the childhood vaccination schedule? 

If childhood vaccines are safe, why are well over half a million vaccinated American children afflicted with autism, while non-vaccinated Amish and Mennonite children rarely suffer from the disorder? Why has the incidence of asthma, allergies, autoimmune disease, Type 1 diabetes and neurological conditions also dramatically increased in vaccinated children?

Furthermore, why do obstetricians give pregnant women influenza vaccines that contain a toxic dose of mercury and why are new babies injected with the Hepatitis B vaccine within hours of birth when there is no medical justification for it?

In this informative lecture, Dr Blaylock addresses these and many other vaccine-related issues. If you are concerned about your and your family's health and want to make an informed decision on behalf of your child or children, this is a really important video for you to watch. You will never look at vaccination and the so-called health care system the same way again.

About Ty & Charlene Bollinger
---------------------------------------
Ty & Charlene Bollinger are devoted Christians, health freedom advocates, health researchers, documentary film producers, and best-selling authors.

After losing several family members to conventional cancer treatments, they set out to learn the truth about cancer and the cancer industry, working together tirelessly to help others to learn the truth that sets them free to live healthy, happy lives.  

Ty & Charlene's heartbreak and grief coupled with their firm belief that chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery were NOT the most effective treatments available for cancer patients, led them on a path of discovery. 
 
On their journey, they interviewed cutting-edge scientists, leading alternative doctors, and groundbreaking researchers to learn about hidden alternative cancer treatments. What they uncovered helped to create The Truth About Cancer and its three awe-inspiring docu-series: ”The Quest for The Cures”, “The Quest for the Cures Continues”, and “The Truth About Cancer: A Global Quest.” 

Ty & Charlene speak frequently at seminars, expos, conferences, and churches. Together, they host a bi-weekly internet news program: TTAC Global Health News: http://bit.ly/ghn-episodes  

Their message is clear: CANCER IS NOT A DEATH SENTENCE. THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE.

Despite the serious side effects, pharmaceutical companies, the medical profession and government authorities continue to bury their heads in the sand, refusing to see a serious problem. In Quebec, the United States and France, as in most industrialized countries, victims are almost without recourse despite the high toxicity of substances such as mercury and aluminum contained in vaccines. With this hard-hitting documentary, Lina B. Moreco highlights a very worrying public health problem. _x000D_
_x000D_
Since they were introduced in the early 20th century, vaccines have been a tremendous medical and scientific success. Today perceived as a necessity, they are so familiar to us that their potential risks are rarely mentioned._x000D_
_x000D_
However, the stakes are significant. Based on recommendations of health agencies, North American children receive about 48 doses of 14 different vaccines before the age of 6 -- double the amount prescribed 25 years earlier. Despite this extraordinary increase, few studies independent of the pharmaceutical industry have been conducted into their long-term side effects. This is a disturbing situation given the numerous toxins, including mercury and aluminum, contained in some commonly administered vaccines._x000D_
_x000D_
Several worried pediatricians and scientists are sounding the alarm. Some of the research underway indicates that vaccination is directly responsible for immune or neurological disorders among certain people genetically or neurologically predisposed to react badly to vaccine components. Cases of autism, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, macrophagic myofasciitis, encephalitis, paralysis and neuropathies indicate the seriousness of the situation._x000D_
_x000D_
Despite these findings, the pharmaceutical industry and government authorities deny there is a serious problem. Relying on perfunctory studies, some of which date back to the late 1920s, they reject out of hand any cause-and-effect relationship. Given the known fact that adding preservatives such as thimerosal (mercury) helps reduce production costs, the reaction of the pharmaceutical industry is at the very least puzzling. Preferring not to question a system that has proved its worth, a majority of the medical profession's members reject any potential toxicity in vaccines._x000D_

vaccines,Vaccinating Children: Public Trust and Health by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health 4 years ago 55 minutes 520 views,"While the majority of Americans vaccinate their children, there are many parents who selectively choose the vaccines to be given or who decline vaccinations altogether. This Forum event, held a few days after the September 10 airing of the NOVA film Vaccines: Calling the Shots, examined the drivers of public perceptions of vaccinations, the threats that vaccine-preventable illnesses pose, and the steps to be taken to restore trust in one of public health’s greatest weapons against infectious diseases.

Presented September 15, 2014 in Partnership with Tangled Bank Studios, a film production company of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and in Collaboration with NOVA, PRI’s The World & WGBH.

vaccines,CALLING THE SHOTS Why Parents Reject Vaccines by Answers for the Family Radio Show 2 years ago 51 minutes 60 views,"12-19-16 Answers for the Family Interview with Jennifer Reich
Host Allen Cardoza

“Recent outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles and whooping cough are focusing attention on this issue, making Reich’s able contribution especially pertinent.” —Kirkus Reviews

“Calling the Shots treads confidently into the explosive terrain of vaccine refusal. In this must-read exploration of the burdens of modern mothering, Reich takes seriously the desires of mothers to make their own decisions to protect their children from risks. But she also shows how anti-vaccine stances by the privileged few may undermine the social compact and threaten the public good. This is a well-written, important, and very timely book.” —Steven Epstein, author of Inclusion: The Politics of Difference in Medical Research

In 2015, California lawmakers voted to approve SB 277, a bill that ends granting vaccine exemptions to parents who cite personal or religious reasons; medical exemptions are still allowed. This ruling came as a huge blow to the powerful anti-vaccination movement, but after 147 people contracted measles at Disneyland in late 2014, the decision was clear. In order to prevent a widespread outbreak of measles, mumps, and rubella, the national vaccination rate must be between 96% and 99%. At the time of the measles outbreak, California’s vaccination rate for MMR was shockingly between 50% and 86%. Immunizations against childhood illnesses are touted as one of the greatest achievements in modern medicine, so why would parents rather risk their child contracting a deadly virus than simply receiving a round of vaccinations?

Without choosing a side in the vaccination debate, sociologist Jennifer A. Reich spent over a decade studying the phenomenon of vaccine refusal and interviewing everyone involved. Reich gives a fascinating account of these parents’ point of view. Placing these stories in dialogue with those of pediatricians who see the devastation vaccine-preventable diseases can cause and the policy makers who aim to create healthy communities, Calling the Shots offers a unique opportunity to understand the points of disagreement on what is best for children, communities, and public health and the opportunities to bridge these differences.

Please everyone see here for information on aluminium detoxification. And Prof Exley's lecture on aluminium poisoning & detoxification of aluminium. Vaccine Safety Conference Session 16 Dr. Christopher Exley
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naajZ1ryNlY
Dr. Christopher Exley- The Systemic Toxicity of Aluminium Adjuvants. Dr. Christopher Exley is the Reader in Bioinorganic Chemistry at The Birchall Centre, Keele University in Staffordshire and Honorary Professor at the UHI Millennium Institute. Exley is a biologist (University of Stirling) with a PhD in the ecotoxicology of aluminium (University of Stirling). His research career (1984-present) has focused upon an intriguing paradox; 'how the third most abundant element of the Earth's crust (aluminium) is non-essential and largely inimical to life'. Investigating this mystery has required research in myriad fields from the basic inorganic chemistry of the reaction of aluminium and silicon to the potentially complex biological availability of aluminium in humans. Exley is also fascinated by the element silicon in relation to living things which, as the second most abundant element of the Earth's crust, is also almost devoid of biological function. One possible function of silicon is to keep aluminium out of biology (biota) and this area of study forms a large part of Exley's research.

Check out my second Reincarnation video here at:

In this video we explore Reincarnation as a device to tell a story that includes The Anti-Vaxxers Movement and shows how silly it really is.  Try to see it as a laugh.  Don't wait, vaccinate.
At the Weigh Station of limbo between life and death, our souls get to reenter the world of the living to start over.  We learn why this process keeps occurring and maybe learn a little bit about ourselves in the process.  
Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each biological death. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the Saṃsāra doctrine of cyclic existence.  It is a central tenet of all major Indian religions, namely Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism.  The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures, and a belief in rebirth/metempsychosis was held by Greek historic figures, such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato.  It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as Spiritism, Theosophy, and Eckankar, and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Australia, East Asia, Siberia, and South America.
Although the majority of denominations within the Abrahamic religions of Christianity, and Islam do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of Kabbalah, the Cathars, Alawites, the Druze, and the Rosicrucians.  The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of Neoplatonism, Orphism, Hermeticism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism of the Roman era as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research. Unity Church and its founder Charles Fillmore teach reincarnation.
In recent decades, many Europeans and North Americans have developed an interest in reincarnation, and many contemporary works mention it.

This rally comes at a time when a measles outbreak has occurred in anti-vaxxer areas, which happens to be a disease that can be life-threatening to young children and the elderly. These anti-science folks are bringing back diseases that we had essentially eradicated, and its all based on a lie. Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins discusses this.

This past weekend, hundreds of anti-vaxxers descended upon Washington state to rally against a proposed bill that would make vaccines in the state mandatory. Basically, what it would do is it would take away parent's right to be conscientious objectors and not have their children vaccinated. They couldn't do that anymore. The state would vaccinate their children is actually similar legislation in California and more legislation kind of spreading throughout the United States. And do you know what else is spreading throughout the United States right now, especially up there in Washington, measles, a disease that we had essentially eradicated decades ago is making a comeback at least 52 confirmed cases in Washington alone and dozens more suspected of this disease that can be fatal, particularly in infants, toddlers, and the elderly or people with weakened immune systems and Dhea. Know why it's making a comeback because of these anti vaccs parents. Let's get something 100 percent straight.
Okay? Vaccines do not cause autism. There is no link between the two. The one nude, the one doctor who made that link was later found to have completely falsified his data, was stripped of his medical license and is now the subject of ridicule for the rest of his life because he lied about the link between vaccines and autism. It does not exist and I have seen so many wonderful people on social media in the last few days make this point and this to me is probably the best point out there about this issue. Why is a dead kid or a kid with a disease that was easily preventable? Why is that better than having a kid with autism? Why are we acting like autism is some kind of death sentence or some kind of social stigma that we need to look upon these people and say, oh my God, how horrible for you.
Your life must suck in every possible way. That's not at all how it is.

Medical memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. 

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together!

moonlanding,"Apollo 11 Moon Landing 20th Anniversary by King Rose Archives 2 years ago 26 minutes 13,145 views","Apollo 11 was the first spaceflight that landed humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material for return to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with Columbia in lunar orbit.

Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16, Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages – a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.

Broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience, Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as ""one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: ""before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""

According to Gizmodo, Curry then paired up with astronaut Scott Kelly to talk about the whole thing.

It reached the lunar surface in mid-December 2013. It was the first soft landing on the Moon since 1976, and the first rover to operate there since the Soviet Lunokhod 2 mission ended in May 1973. 

Yutu encountered operational difficulties after about a month on the Moon, and was unable to move after the end of the second lunar night. It continued to gather useful information for some months afterward. In October 2015, Yutu set the record for the longest operational period for a rover on the Moon.",China's Moon: Journey of the Jade Rabbit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5y1JlgCCwg,5,,0,254,50634,847,69,0,361,51911
moonlanding,"State TV in China broadcasts Moon landing by The Telegraph 5 years ago 60 seconds 9,972 views","China successfully carried out the world's first soft landing of a space probe on the moon in nearly four decades, state media said. 

Saturday's successful mission is the latest stage in an ambitious space program that aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the moon. 

The unmanned Chang'e 3 lander, named after a mythical Chinese goddess of the moon, touched down on Earth's nearest neighbour following a 12-minute landing process. 

State-run China Central Television showed a computer-generated image of the Chang'e 3 lander's path as it approached the surface of the moon. 

As it was just hundreds of yards away, the lander's camera began broadcasting images of the moon's surface. 

The probe carries a six-wheeled moon rover called ""Yutu,"" or ""Jade Rabbit,"" the goddess' pet. After landing on a fairly flat, Earth-facing part of the moon, the rover was scheduled to separate from Chang'e eight hours later and embark on a three-month scientific exploration. 

China sent its first taikonaut into space in 2003, becoming the third nation after Russia and the United States to achieve manned space travel independently.

No doubt you’ve heard some of the completely unexplainable stories about the moon.  There are the enigmatic structures that made front-page news of major new publications… but were then dismissed from all media, and even photo-shopped out of photos.  There are the strange “lunar wave” videos of recent years, which seem to show the moon’s image actually jumping - as though it were a projected hologram; and.. you only need to search YouTube to see hundreds of entirely credible videos of strange lights, flurries, and unidentified flying aircraft departing and landing on the surface of the moon.  
Yet, the US supposedly quit landing on the moon in 1973, was our every scientific question answered?   Why are these credible testimonies ignored… or dismissed?    Could there be more to that ball in the sky than meets the eye

If you research the moon, you might be surprised.  Its reference in ancient history, its perfect geometrical symmetry, astronaut testimonies, all seem to point to only one logical conclusion:   that our moon is most likely a hollowed out structure, and an artificial satellite, that was intentionally placed into Earth’s orbit only a few hundred thousand years ago – and that the advanced engineers accomplished this intending not only to influence the Earth’s biology but to oversee and control her inhabitants.

Hello everyone! Welcome to our channel!
In 1975, Donald Wilson published ""Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon: Is Our Nearest Neighbor A Huge Alien Spacecraft?"" in which he provided evidence to support this theory. In 1976, George H. Leonard published ""Someone on the Moon"", in which he reprinted several NASA photos of the lunar surface claiming the theory above.
Whether those mentioned above were right or not, we at Smart Banana decided to see some of the mysteries surrounding this natural or artificial Earth satellite!

moonlanding,President Moon looks to boost ties with Malaysia based on Hallyu and Halal by ARIRANG NEWS 13 hours ago 110 seconds 431 views,"문 대통령, 말레이시아서 할랄, 한류산업 강조

President Moon Jae-in is in Malaysia,… the second leg of his three-stop ASEAN tour.
After having wrapped his visit to Brunei that focused much on energy and infrastructure cooperation,… the South Korean leader is eyeing high-tech and Halal industry.
Shin Se-min files this report from Kuala Lumpur.  
President Moon's first day in Malaysia started with an effort to build ties between the countries in Hallyu -- or the Korean Wave -- and the Halal industry. 
Attending an exhibition in the heart of the Malaysian capital,... the president said the driving force bringing the two countries together is the the Korean Wave of entertainment spreading across the world.
""If Korea and Malaysia work together and jointly enter the market, it will become a new model of economic cooperation.""
The president said that by integrating Malaysia as a leading hub for Halal, and Korea's own culture of Hallyu, the two can create a synergy that spans the world.
The value of the international halal market currently stands at over 2-trillion U.S. dollars, and its expected to grow by another trillion or more by the year 2022.
The South Korean leader's tour of ASEAN nations is partly meant to boost his country's ties with the region under the administration's New Southern Policy, which also targets India.
It also comes ahead of anniversary next year in which Korea and ASEAN will celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations.

""The president wants to boost ties with Malaysia even further so that they flourish in the fast-changing field of technology,… while also helping Korea enter the Halal market, which includes a quarter of the world’s population. 
Shin Se-min, Arirang News, Kuala Lumpur.""

5. Alien structures found on Moon
Ufologists have found traces extraterrestrial civilizations on the Moon. New satellite images, allegedly taken by an orbital probe that has been orbiting the Earth's natural satellite for seven years, showed strange objects on the surface of the Moon.
""UFO catchers"" studied the photos and found strange-looking ""formations"" on the Moon. Ufologists believe that the images captured the wreckage of an alien ship that crashed on the Moon. The researchers could also see a chain of footprints that lead to the mysterious object.

4. Alien Image found in the image of Nasa 
These images, were taken from the NASA Curiosity Rover droid which is scouring the surface for signs of life - but appeared to have missed it, if the alien chasers are to be believed. In this image a head, torso and legs can clearly be distinguished.""
Everything is there in the original image, whatever it is it looks humanoid, reminds me of the Atacama Alien, about the same size too, this one is around 6 inches.""

3. Aliens may have sent a strong signal from sun like star
Astronomers engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) are training their instruments on a star around 94 light years from Earth after a very strong signal was detected by a Russian telescope.
An international team of researchers is now examining the radio signal and its star, HD 164595 -- described in a paper by Italian astronomer Claudio Maccone and others as a ""strong candidate for SETI"" -- in the hopes of determining its origin.
""The signal from HD 164595 is intriguing, because it comes from the vicinity of a sun-like star, and if it's artificial, its strength is great enough that it was clearly made by a civilization with capabilities beyond those of humankind,"" astronomer Douglas Vakoch, president of METI International, which searches for life beyond Earth, tells CNN. Whenever a strong signal is detected, ""it's a good possibility for some nearby civilization to be detected,"" Maccone tells CNN.

2. Alien skeleton found on mars
A new image beamed back by the Curiosity rover is ultimate proof that the red planet had life in the distant past. new images show what appear to be fossilized remains of an Alien” creature on Mars.
Looking at the image I have to say they look a bit strange, but, does strange mean Alien? Well… lets not jump to conclusions.
""The relic has a large skull adorned with an ornate or decorative head piece, this could indicate that its the remains of a king, religious icon or perhaps a fallen warrior,""

1. Alien Antenna found on Moon surface

Mark Sawalha, a UFO hunter based in Finland, spotted a 'strange spike' in a Nasa photo of the lunar surface. He claims is an alien antenna that could be located on the roof of an alien base. 
'Aliens are using moon minerals and they have bases there too. Many other findings support this theory,' Mr Sawalha he told the Sun.

While he does not spell out what these findings are, the UFO spotter claims that Nasa knows about them and has chosen not to publish them.
He also speculates that the presence of aliens on the lunar surface may be the reason that Nasa hasn't sent any manned spacecraft to Earth's satellite since the Apollo missions.
The images, captured by the space agency's Lunar Orbiter, appear to show a small dark 'spike' that casts a shadow. Along with a mysterious antenna-like spike, zooming in on the photo also appears to reveal a 'clear plateau' under the antenna.

Lyrics:
I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Whether it's day or night

It’s believed I was created 
4.5 billion years ago
When A Mars-sized body collided with the earth
Their debris formed me real slow

Meteors, Asteroids, and comets 
Struck my surface for a billion years
Due to the fact that they don’t burn up
in my thin atmosphere 

If you wonder what a moon is
It’s a natural satellite 
One that orbits a single planet
the planet orbits a star so bright  

Scientific observations
were first made in 1610
by Galileo Galilei   
The Astronomer Italian

I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Wheather it's day or night

When the Earth spins on its axis
Ocean levels stay the same
then the moons gravitational pull
Creates the tides that we see change

238,900 miles from the Earth
Is the distance measured
When the first spaceship
landed on my turf

The reason you see one half 
Of my surface all the time
Is because my rotations the same speed 
as the earth taught in this rhyme  

It takes 27 earth days 
for me to rotate once around
There is no air on my surface 
So you won't hear any sound


I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Whether it's day or night",The Moon/Moon Songs For Kids/Moon Song for Children,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3YfLAAi3Vc,5,,0,158,2563198,2923,572,0,1306,2567999

Our moon has been around for billions of years. The Moon has been known since prehistoric times and it's the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun. Recently NASA's ARTEMIS mission show scientists some strange colouration on the surface of the Moon. It was then announced that this was due to a form of sunburn. It's well known that our moon has no global magnetic field. Magnetized rocks that can be found close to the surface do have small spots of magnetic fields.

1 small correction - I read my script wrong and said the moon was 285,000 miles up... nope its 238,000 miles up... Sometimes i rush thru reading the script that i mis-read information. This is one of those times. Sorry for the mistake, still doesnt change the argument.
For all of you who thought I went soft on flat earth!

moonlanding,"What Happened On the Moon? - Analysis of the Lunar Photography by UFOTV® The Disclosure Network 8 years ago 2 hours, 13 minutes 2,891,863 views","Part 1: Analysis of the Lunar Photography - This compelling video throws into serious doubt the authenticity of the Apollo missions and features information that challenges the declared abilities of NASA to successfully send a man to the Moon and return him safely to Earth. New evidence clearly suggests that NASA hoaxed pictures allegedly taken on the lunar surface. These findings are supported by analysis and the testimony of experts from a wide variety of scientific disciplines.

Note: This was the hardest film for us to post here at UFOTV, as most of us were born around the Apollo era and many of us hold NASA's achievement of landing a Man on the Moon and bringing him safely back, as sacred. But in the interest of remaining neutral and posting all information on controversies in science, regardless of our personal beliefs and those of the management at UFOTV, we bring you what critics have chosen as the greatest filmed investigation on this matter to date.

As powerful as the evidence presented in this film and its sister film may seem, we highly recommend that you view our film called ""Quantum Hologram & ESP - Astronaut Edgar Mitchell,"" that sheds light on Edgar Mitchell's experience as the 6th man to walk upon the Moon and his experience aboard Apollo 14 at that time. His experience during this mission as described on this presentation must not be overlooked.

In the first half, aerospace and defense systems developer Sir Charles Shults refuted Moon landing hoax theories, and detailed his latest adventure of re-creating footage of the original Moon landing with a movie stunt team. He also talked about new developments in space exploration, and his views of ancient Mars. 
Many believe the Moon landings may have been a hoax, he suggested, because the Apollo program ended a long time ago, and they also distrust what the government tells them. Among the anomalies people point to is that the American flag fluttered in photos even though there was no air on the moon.
